            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

Of this nature is this booke where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withall I am bold to preſent your Honour, preſuming in that reſpect vpon ſo much the greater acceptance. In the peruſall whereof, as you ſhall meet with diuerſe paſſages not vnprofita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, ſo amongst others with one ſhort one, the tedder of the text not giuing larger liberty, concerning the right, and religious gouernment of a family. A point of great conſequence, and vſe for all, but for none more then great perſons, whom God hath betruſted with the gouernment of great families. <hi>Philemons</hi> houſe is here honoured with the title of a Church. <hi>To the Church that is in thine houſe.</hi> Moſt great houſes haue the ornaments of <hi>Chappels,</hi> but few the honour of <hi>Churches.</hi> So irreligious and irregular are the followers of many great perſonages, that they ſeeme to metamorphoſe their Maſters houſes, as the Iewes did the Lords Houſe, which ſhould haue been <hi>an houſe of prayer, into a den of thieues.</hi> Yea ſo pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>digiouſly inordinate are the courſes, and carriages of ſome fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>milies, that a man in regard of their retinue, may iudge the Prophets curſe to be fallen vpon them. Namely: That <hi>Ziim doe lodge there,</hi> and that <hi>their houſes are full of Ochim,</hi> or <hi>of dolefull creatures, Oſtriches dwell there, and Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyres dance there, Iim and Dragons are in their pleaſant Palaces, Eſay</hi> 13. 21, 22. And this plague, that great
<pb facs="tcp:257:3"/> houſes are haunted with ſuch vncleane ſpirits, whence comes it, but from a double neglect in Gouernours, either in the <hi>chu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing,</hi> or <hi>ordering</hi> their ſeruants? In the <hi>choice</hi> of ſeruants, what is leſſe regarded then the <hi>Truth</hi> and <hi>Power</hi> of Religion? Moſt chuſe as <hi>Salomon</hi> did <hi>Ieroboam,</hi> 1. <hi>King.</hi> 11. 28. <hi>he ſaw that the young man was meet for the worke,</hi> and therefore entertained him into his ſeruice. But with what iſſue? He wrought a miſchiefe to and againſt his houſe. It had beene happy for <hi>Salomons</hi> houſe, that a man of more conſcience, though of leſſe skill, had been retained. How many ſcruple not to entertaine very <hi>Ieroboams,</hi> ſo be it they be meet for their worke, though otherwiſe their religion be either a Popiſh, pup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pet and calfe-worſhip, or a flat irreligion? The world is not ſo empty and barren, but it is poſſible if care were had, to finde Skill, and Conſcience, Ability and Honeſtie, matcht in one and the ſame ſcruant. But in the <hi>ordering</hi> of families is as foule a neglect, whilſt most maſters are of <hi>Sallioes</hi> faith, that matters of faith and religion belong not to their cure. Hence is it that they neither conſtraine them to the true ſeruice of God, nor reſtraine them from Popery, profaneneſſe, diſſolute &amp; diſordered life. <hi>Ioſhuaes</hi> reſolution, <hi>I and my houſe vvill ſerue the Lord,</hi> is growne out of credit with the world. Let a ſeruant faile in the careleſſe performance of his place, in the neglect of his Maſters profit; nay, if but a paltry dog, or hawke be vnfed, or miſdieted, oh the tragedies, oh the blusters, and terrible thunder-cracks of fierce and furious language that enſue! But let a ſeruant be ignorant, a neglecter or deſpiſer of Gods worſhip, a ſwearer, a Sabbath-breaker, a drunkard, an vncleane perſon, yet, I will not ſay againſt ſuch there is no law, but againſt ſuch there is no anger, no rebuke, no cenſure, no making the family Church-like in the excommunication, and eiection of theſe <hi>Satyres,</hi> and <hi>Oſtriches.</hi> All ſuch Gouernors are as farre from the honour, as the practice of <hi>Philemon.</hi> Whoſe example if happily any great Ones ſhould conceit to be too lowe for their imitation (though the meaneſt of the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture-Saints are patternes for the greateſt) may they be pleaſed
<pb facs="tcp:257:4"/> to remember not onely thoſe ancient Precedents, <hi>Abraham, Ioſhua,</hi> and <hi>Dauid,</hi> all three honourable in this particular, but to looke a little neerer their owne dayes, to a man of their owne ranke, I meane, that right religious, and worthy Prince of <hi>Anhalt,</hi> of whom <hi>Melancthon</hi> reports, <hi>That his Cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber</hi>

ONE<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>SIMVS, a naughty ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uant, running away from his maſter PHI<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>LEMON, lights vpon PAVL, by whoſe meanes and miniſtery hee being
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:257:6"/> conuerted, is returned back to his Maſter, with this letter of PAVL, in his behalfe written to his Maſter, for pardoning him his former miſdemeanour, and receiuing him into fauour againe.</p>
                     <p>This Epiſtle is of another nature then any other written either by PAVL, or any of the other A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtles, for though ſometimes they write to ſome one particular perſon, as this our Apoſtle to TI<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>MOTHY and TITVS, and IOHN, to GAIVS and the elect LADY: yet euen then they write of matters concerning the whole Church and the <hi>common ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uation,</hi> as IVDE ſpeaketh, <hi>Iude</hi> 3.</p>
                     <p>But here as the perſon is but a particular man, ſo the matter is a perſonall matter proper to PHILE<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>MON and his family, concerning the entertayne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of a fugitiue ſeruant into his family and fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uour againe. One would thinke this were too low and meane an argument for the Spirit of GOD to handle. But yet queſtionleſſe, PAVL was as well moued by the inſtinct, and aſſiſted with the power<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full preſence of the Holy Ghoſt, in the writing of this, as any other of his Epiſtles, as (beſides the common conſent of the Church) by the holy, hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenly, and gracious Character of ſpeech, agreeable to his other Epiſtles may eaſily appeare. Obſerue therefore,</p>
                     <p>How hereby the Lord would confirme our faith <note place="margin">1. <hi>The Scriptures written by di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uine inſpiration.</hi>
                        </note> in the truth and certainty of other parts of Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture; for if euen this Epiſtle written to one man of a priuate matter, reſpecting his owne family, were yet writen by the inſpiration of the Spirit of Truth,
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:257:6"/> how much more may we aſcertaine our ſelues, that other bookes, treating of higher matters, were not penned by the will of man, but indited by the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit of God himſelfe. If when PAVL writes to PHI<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>LEMON of the receiuing of a poore ſlaue, the Spirit of God leadeth his hand in writing, how much more when he writeth to whole Churches of Chriſt and our Redemption by him, of Faith, Repentance, Iuſtification, and ſuch like myſteries.</p>
                     <p>Secondly. As hereby our aſſurance of the infal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lible <note place="margin">2. <hi>Gods prouidence in the preſerua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Bookes of Scripture.</hi>
                        </note> Truth of the Scriptures is confirmed, ſo like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe of Gods Prouidence, and watchfull care in the preſeruation of them whole, without any loſſe to this preſent day. Some are of opinion that whole Bookes of Scripture are loſt; and among the reſt ſome of S. PAVLS Epiſtles, written to whole Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches, as to <hi>Corinth, Laodicea, &amp;c.</hi> But this little E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſtle riſeth vp as a great witneſſe againſt them: for if the prouidence of God hath extended it ſelfe to the leſſer, how much more to the greater? It is the argument of our Sauiour, <hi>Matth.</hi> 6. God, by his prouidence clotheth the graſſe of the field, how much more will he doe the like to men, to his owne Elect? Are not they of much greater value then Lillies? So here by like proportion, was not the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſtle to the <hi>Corinthians,</hi> if there euer were ſuch a one loſt, of greater worth then this to PHILEMON? Whereof yet, not the leaſt jot, or tittle, hath miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>carryed, though in regard of the obiect, and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paratiuely in reſpect of others, it may ſeeme a meane Epiſtle, (for otherwiſe indeed nothing of the
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:257:7"/> Spirits inditing is to bee counted meane.) How much more then would the Lord by the eye of his prouidence haue watched ouer other Epiſtles and Bookes, handling matters of greater moment and conſequence? If any part of the Canon ſhould be loſt, one would thinke, in regard of that ſpeciall care which God hath of his Churches good, it ſhould be that which might beſt be ſpared, as not being of ſo neceſſary vſe as the reſt. Now, howſoeuer euery parcell of the Canon, and ſo this Epiſtle be of ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gular vſe, yet we cannot imagine how an Epiſtle or Booke of a more inferiour argument, leſſe reſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cting the whole body of the Church, ſhould haue beene framed by the motion of Gods Spirit. What a folly then is it for vs to imagine that Gods eye, being vigilant and watchfull in looking to Bookes of leſſe vſe, ſhould be ſo heauy and drowſie, when Bookes of greater vſe ſhould haue beene preſerued? As though he that is carefull for the ſafe cuſtodie of common pieces of ſiluer, would be negligent in looking to ſome rare or rich Iewell, or precious ſtone. Wee may then by this ſmall Epiſtle, written of ſo ſmall a matter and yet remayning, more then probably gather, that either there were no ſuch Bookes euer written, as they ſay are loſt, or elſe if there were, that they were not Canonicall.</p>
                     <p>This doctrine of the Canon entirely preſerued, S. PAVL plainly confirmeth, <hi>Rom.</hi> 15. ſaying, <hi>What<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoeuer was written, was written for our learning.</hi> Now if ſome of the Canon be loſt, what learning can we poſſibly gather out of it? Beſides, in theſe Bookes
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:257:7"/> we haue, we want nothing, as in many bookes of the Heathen, which are maymed and imperfect, ſometimes without head, ſometimes without taile, the iniquitie of the times dealing with them as the King of <hi>Ammon</hi> with DAVIDS Embaſſadors. But here is no ſuch clipping or curtayling of the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, here be no <hi>libri</hi> 
                        <gap reason="foreign">
                           <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                        </gap>. Here comes in no <hi>De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſunt per pauca. Deſiderantur nonnulla.</hi> Thoſe bookes wee haue, wee haue whole and entire, no one ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence, no one piece of a ſentence is wanting. Now how is it likely that that God who would not ſuffer the leaſt tittle to be blotted out of theſe Bookes we haue, would yet ſuffer whole Bookes to be razed out at once out of the number of the Canon? What, hath the prouidence of GOD leſſe reſpected his owne Bookes then the Paynims? whereof though many be gone, yet not without ſome reliques and fragments ſtill remayning. But here, Time which was more fauourable to their bookes, nibbling vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on them, and as a Moth conſuming them by little and little, here a piece, and there a piece, deales farre more vnmercifully with the Scriptures, as a Lyon cruſhing them in pieces at the firſt, with a wide ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping throat, as an open ſepulchre deuouring and ſwallowing downe in great gobs, whole bookes at once: In ſo much that the leaſt footſteps of them are not to be ſeene. I dwell the longer in this point, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe it is of ſuch ſingular vſe and comfort.</p>
                     <p>For firſt, this care of God in preſeruing his Word, <label type="milestone">
                           <seg type="milestoneunit">Vſe </seg>1</label> ſetteth out and commendeth vnto vs his care for the preſeruation of his Church, which is vpheld
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:257:8"/> and maintayned by this Word. Wherefore ſo long as we ſee Gods prouidence ſo carefully watching o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer the Scriptures, we may put our ſelues in aſſured hope that he will neuer faile nor forſake his Church. If he meant to do ſo, to what end ſhould the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture ſerue? There is no vſe of them out of the Church, for the benefit of the Church, doubtleſſe, are they kept, not for Turks and Canibals. As long then as wee ſee the Word of GOD continuing, ſo long may wee aſſure our ſelues, that God will ſtill continue a remnant at the leaſt of his Church, and a holy Seed, which ſhall be fed and fatted with this wholeſome food, whereof at the firſt it was made.</p>
                     <p>And as this doctrine is comfortable to the whole <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> Church in generall, ſo likewiſe to euery member thereof in ſpeciall, who here-hence haue this gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious and ſweet Meditation yeelded vnto them. What, hath GOD beene ſo carefull to keepe his Word written with inke in Parchment, ſo pure, ſo perfect: notwithſtanding the endeuours of Satan to mayme and mangle, yea to corrupt and adulte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate it? O then, will hee not much more, hauing written his Law in our hearts, by the finger of his owne Spirit, maintaine this his owne handy-worke and writing, againſt all the daſhes, blots, and blurs, which Satan and our owne corruption make conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nually to deforme, yea and if it were poſſible, who<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to deface and raze out this holy writing? If the Word of God printed in books, after the ſame man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner that the word of men is, could neuer yet be ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>literated, much more then ſhall the ſame Word, af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:257:8"/> a wonderfull and extraordinary manner, prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted and ſtamped in the fleſhly tables of our hearts, retayne there his forme and figure for euer, as being written with an indeleble Character.</p>
                     <p>Thirdly, The holy Ghoſt, both firſt of all exci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting, <note place="margin">3. <hi>The honour that God doth repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting ſinners.</hi>
                        </note> and ſtirring PAVL to the writing of this E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſtle for ONESIMVS, as alſo guiding and gouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of him in the writing of it, we may obſerue the great honour that was done to this poore ſeruant now repenting and becomming the ſeruant, yea the freeman of Chriſt. The holy Ghoſt himſelfe writes a letter in his behalfe to his Maſter, for it was not ſo much PAVLS doing as the Spirits. PAVL wrote, but the Spirit indited. If wee can get the Kings letter to ſome that may doe vs good, we thinke it a great fauour, and our ſelues much honored. What a honour was this then for ONESIMVS, to haue the great King of Heauen and Earth to ſet his holy Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cretarie, PAVL, on worke in writing, and his owne Majeſtie in inditing this letter for him? This teach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth vs that the Lord is no reſpecter of perſons, but that according to his promiſe he will honour them that honour him, be they neuer ſo baſe and diſho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nourable in the world, euen bond-ſlaues, as this O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>NESIMVS was.</p>
                     <p>As on the contrary, he will bring ſhame and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proch vpon them, who feare not to diſhonour him, though neuer ſo honourable outwardly in the Word. What then, though thou art ſmall and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpiſed, though thou haſt but the low degree of a ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uant, be not diſcomfited, euen ſo was ONESIMVS,
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:257:9"/> yet honouring the Lord by his vnfained repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance, ſee how the Lord honours him, taking the paines himſelfe to write this Epiſtle for him, and thereby eternizing his memorie to all poſterities. Many great and mightie Monarchs are dead and rotten, and their names are dead with them; it is not ſo much as knowne, whether there were ſuch men on the earth; in whom is verified that of the Pſalmiſt, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 37. 35, 36. But ONESIMVS, a baſe ſlaue, hath a name of eternall, and that moſt happie memorie, giuen him: So that whereſoeuer this E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſtle ſhall come, this which the Holy Ghoſt hath done for him, ſhall be ſpoken of, for a memoriall of him.</p>
                     <p>The like, through Gods gracious prouidence, hath befalne many other poore ones in this world: as, the Woman that powred the Oyntment on Chriſt, RAHAB, SIMON of <hi>Cyrene,</hi> &amp; diuers others; who though otherwiſe ignoble and obſcure, yet are now true Canonized Saints indeed, hauing their names regiſtred and recorded in Gods owne holy Canon. Whereas, according to that of the Pſalmiſt, Princes themſelues haue had contempt powred vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on them, contemning God, and haue beene quite forgotten, forgetting the Lord. Thus the Lord knoweth how to depreſſe and debaſe the loftie and lordly, yea, euen to diſ-robe and vnthrone Kings, and to caſt them downe vpon the dunghill; and on the contrarie, to exalt and aduance baſe beggers and bondſlaues, and that euen from the Dungeon and dunghill of Darkneſſe and Obſcuritie, to the
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:257:9"/> Scepter oftentimes, and Chaire of Eſtate, as HAN<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>NA ſweetly ſingeth, 1. <hi>Sam.</hi> 2. 8. that ſo the righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous ſeeing theſe ſo iuſt and righteous, ſo wiſe and mercifull workes of Gods prouidence, might re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ioyce, and all iniquitie might ſtop her mouth.</p>
                     <p>Fourthly, in this example of PAVL, writing by <note place="margin">4. <hi>A Chriſtian may ſhew a ſanctified heart in ſpeaking of the meaneſt things.</hi>
                        </note> diuine inſpiration of this ſo meane and abiect an obiect, we may further learne, That there is no mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter ſo baſe, or vile, in the ſpeaking or writing where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, a Chriſtian man may not bewray the inward grace and ſanctification of his heart. For ſo here PAVL writing to PHILEMON, not of Iuſtification, not of Predeſtination, or any ſuch profound myſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie, but onely of a poore vaſſall and bondſlaue, yet ſee how preſently hee mounteth vp into the very Heauens! So, that howſoeuer this Epiſtle, in regard of the matter, ſeeme to creepe on the ground, yet in regard of the manner of handling it, it may ſeeme with the wings of the Eagle, to ſoare vp aloft, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt attaining the height, the might, and maieſtie of his other Epiſtles. Though wee now are not to looke for ſuch a meaſure of the Spirit, as PAVL had in writing and ſpeaking, yet we in our meaſure muſt labour, according to this preſident giuen vs in this place, to ſpeake and write holily and graciouſly e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen of common and triuiall matters. For they are deceiued, who thinke, that it is for Preachers onely in their preaching, thus to ſpeake; or if it belong to others, onely then, when they are occaſioned to ſpeake of matters of Religion. No; gracious ſpeech is not to be pent vp in ſo narrow a roome, as the
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:257:10"/> Pulpit, it is not to bee confined within ſo ſtrait bounds, as matters of ſaluation. But the Precept of the Apoſtle is generall, <hi>Let your ſpeech</hi> (of what matter ſoeuer it treateth) <hi>be alwayes ſeaſoned with the ſalt of Grace, Col.</hi> 4. 6. Yea, as in meats, the more ſubiect they be to putrifaction, the more need they haue of powdering; ſo in the matters of ſpeech, the readier we be in vulgar and ordinarie matters to forget our ſelues, the more need haue wee the more throughly to ſeaſon them with this holy Salt. And as in the members of our bodie, thoſe parts which are moſt vncomely, haue the greater comeli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of apparell put vpon them, 1. <hi>Cor.</hi> 12. 23. So in the obiects of our ſpeech, the meaner, the baſer they be, the more need haue they, that this their na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kedneſſe ſhould be couered with the glorious gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of gracious ſpeech. Why then ſhould we be aſhamed of the Language of <hi>Canaan</hi> in our com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon talke? Why ſhould not the good man, out of the good treaſurie of his heart, bring forth ſweet and ſauourie ſpeech, euen then when he communeth of common and ordinarie matters? Doth not euerie one, of what Nation ſoeuer hee is, Dutch, French, or Engliſh, by his Dialect bewray his Countrey, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes alike, whatſoeuer the ſubiect of his ſpeech be? Why then ſhould not wee as well approue the cele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtiall <hi>Canaan</hi> to be our Countrey, by the ſpirituall proprietie of ſpeech which that Countrey hath? They then that are aſhamed of this Language in their communication, of this ſtyle in their writing, ſhew plainely, that they are not Citizens of the hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenly
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:257:10"/> Ieruſalem. But if PAVLS letter, written of a domeſticall buſineſſe, be Scripture, why ſhould any be aſhamed to grace and garniſh their letters of the ſame kind with the holy phraſes of the Scripture? Yet many are ſo farre from this, that euen then, when they ſpeake or write of points of Religion, they doe it ſo vnſauourily and ſo vngraciouſly, as that the vnſoundneſſe of their rotten hearts is there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by manifeſtly layd open. PAVL ſetteth a grace and a gloze vpon baſe matters, by his holy character of ſpeech; theſe men pollute and prophane things, in themſelues glorious and excellent, touching them with the baſe language of their vncircumciſed lips, of their impure and myrie mouthes.</p>
                     <p>Fiftly, by S. PAVLS diuine handling this ſo low <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="5"/> a ſubiect, we may eaſily ſee what to iudge of thoſe Epiſtles, which, as it is pretended, were written by <note place="margin">
                           <hi>The Epiſtles of</hi> Paul <hi>to</hi> Seneca <hi>forged.</hi>
                        </note> this our Apoſtle to SENECA. The truth is, they are baſtards and counterfeits, S. PAVL will not owne them for his: They haue his name indeed, but not the leaſt dram or drop of his Spirit; they ſauour not of his Apoſtolicall grauitie and maieſtie, which ſhi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth euen in this, the leaſt of all his Epiſtles. In thoſe forged Epiſtles, farre higher matters are ſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken of; but alas, how coldly, how dryly, and poore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly! yet here behold a poore pettie matter ſet forth with that pithineſſe and powerfulneſſe of ſpeech, as is admirable. Now, is there any likelyhood, that PAVL ſhould be ſo farre vnlike himſelfe, in a low matter to flye aloft, and in high and loftie ones to creepe on the ground? To put life into things al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:257:11"/> dead in themſelues, quickning them with the warmth and ſpirits of his ſpeech, and to take life from things in themſelues full of life, cooling them with an ycie and frozen manner of handling?</p>
                     <p>Sixtly, obſerue in this Epiſtle, occaſioned by O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>NESIMVS <note place="margin">6. <hi>God turns mens ſinnes to the Churches ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uantage.</hi>
                        </note> his running away from his Maſter, the wonderfull wiſedome, power, and mercie of GOD, drawing light out of darkneſſe, turning the ſinnes of men to the aduantage of his Church. The whole Church of GOD reapeth benefit by ONESIMVS his flight; for vnleſſe he had runne away, ſhee had neuer enioyed this excellent Epiſtle, containing ſo many ſingular inſtructions. As therefore that Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther called ADAMS fall a happie fall, in regard of the happie conſequences thereof to the elect, ſo in the ſame reſpect may we call this flight of ONESI<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>MVS, a happie flight.</p>
                     <p>Thus much in generall from the occaſion and argument of this Epiſtle, being a part of the holy Canon.</p>
                     <p>Now to the words in particular. In this firſt Verſe is contained the inſcription of the Epiſtle: In which are ſet downe, Firſt, the perſons writing, which are two: firſt, the principall, PAVL, &amp;c. ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly, leſſe principall, and TIMOTHIE, &amp;c. Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly, the perſons written vnto, which alſo are two: firſt, thoſe whom this Epiſtle more ſpecially concernes, PHILEMON and APPHIA, Gouernors of the Family: ſecondly, thoſe whom it leſſe con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned; firſt, ARCHIPPVS, a Soiourner, as it is pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bable, in the Houſe; ſecondly, the reſt of the Family.</p>
                     <pb n="13" facs="tcp:257:11"/>
                     <p> To begin with the firſt Verſe; The perſons wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting: firſt, the principall Writer is deſcribed, firſt, by his <hi>proper Name,</hi> PAVL, ſecondly, by his <hi>Condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, A Priſoner;</hi> and this his condition of reſtraint from the cauſe of it, <hi>A Priſoner of</hi> IESVS CHRIST.</p>
                     <p>Firſt, for his <hi>Name,</hi> PAVL, ſee CALVIN on <hi>Rom.</hi> 1. to whoſe opinion, thinking it was giuen him vpon his infranchiſement into the Citie of <hi>Rome,</hi> I wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lingly ſubſcribe. Secondly, his <hi>Condition,</hi> wherein now he was when he wrote this Epiſtle. A priſoner of Ieſus Chriſt; not that Chriſt caſt him into priſon: no, in this ſenſe he was NEROES priſoner, and not Chriſts. But his meaning is, that for Chriſts ſake, that is, for preaching and maintayning of his Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pell he was impriſoned. This impriſonment is that which LVKE mentioned, <hi>Acts</hi> 20.</p>
                     <p>Firſt then obſerue, that this Epiſtle came out of <label type="milestone">

PAVL wrote it being in bonds, whereby it appeareth that the priſon is ſo farre from impri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoning <note place="margin">Gods Spirit can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be impriſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned.</note> and ſtreightning the Spirit and Word of God in the hearts of his children, that rather it en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>largeth them. See what an excellent Epiſtle PAVL writes in the priſon. So likewiſe did hee many o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers beſides this, as to the <hi>Galathians, Epheſians, Coloſsians, Philippians,</hi> two to TIMOTHY, all moſt ſweet and heauenly Epiſtles, written by the inſpira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Spirit.</p>
                     <p>The Spirit therefore was PAVLS Companion in the priſon, and ſo is he to all Gods children that are priſoners of Ieſus Chriſt, then renewing his former acquaintance with them, and in more ſpeciall ſort
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:257:12"/> communicating himſelfe vnto them, whereby it commeth to paſſe, that at ſuch times, and in ſuch e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtates, they are more fit for holy duties then in any other. Then pray they more feelingly and feruent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8. then alſo as here we ſee writ, they exhort more powerfully and paſſionately, as me thinketh, in thoſe Epiſtles, which PAVL wrote in the priſon, there ſeemeth a greater meaſure of holy zeale and feruent affections then in any other. So that though in none of theſe Epiſtles, he had made any mention of his impriſonment, yet the obſeruing Reader might eaſily haue ſaid, Theſe Epiſtles ſmell of the priſon, as hee ſaid of the elaborate Oration of the Orator, that it ſmelled of the candle. O happy pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, that brought forth ſuch Epiſtles! Let vs not then be afraid of the priſon, for there the Spirit will meete vs. Let vs not be afraid of thoſe which can indeede impriſon the body and bind it: but the Word of God they cannot bind, that came to IE<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>REMIE againe and againe in the priſon-houſe, <hi>Iere.</hi> 33. 1. The holy Spirit of God they cannot ſhut vp; nay, by this meanes they make more roome for it in our hearts, as appeareth by this and many other E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſtles, for all which we are in ſome ſort beholding to the priſon. So likewiſe may wee thanke the pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon for many ſweet Meditations and Monuments, which of late dayes the holy Martyrs wrote: who for their liues could not haue done the like, before they came into the priſon, as not feeling that ſweet preſence of the Comforter, who profited his ſtrength in their weakneſſe. Whereupon ſome of
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:257:12"/> them haue ſaid, the priſon hath beene to them as a heauenly Palace, and ſweet Paradiſe of pleaſure. So ALGERIVS, an Italian Martyr, dates his Epiſtle, <hi>From the delectable Hortyard of the Leonine priſon,</hi> FOXE <hi>Martyrolog.</hi> So fit a time is our affliction for familiaritie with the Spirit; ſo fit a place is the pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon to be the Studie and Cloſet for thoſe in whom the Spirit dwelleth, to hatch, and bring forth holy and heauenly Meditations.</p>
                     <p>But now PAVL writing this Epiſtle in the priſon, <label type="milestone">
                           <seg type="milestoneunit">Doct. </seg>2</label> as many others alſo, herein further appeareth the <note place="margin">Gods prouidence towards his chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren in priſon.</note> good prouidence of God: firſt, in that euen in the time of this his reſtraint, he had yet libertie of pen, inke, and paper, yea and of a Scribe too ſometimes, and thoſe which did miniſter vnto him. See <hi>Acts</hi> 28. 16. When he was brought priſoner to <hi>Rome,</hi> he found at the firſt this fauour, that whereas other priſoners that came ouer with him, were deliuered to the generall Captayne, hee was ſuffered to dwell in a houſe by himſelfe, hauing only a Souldier at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tending on him. In ſo much as many reſorted daily vnto him, to whom without any let hee preached the Goſpell two yeeres together. So likewiſe IE<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>REMIE in his impriſonment, had the benefit of his Scribe BARVCH. And our Martyrs of late, though nothing ſo fauourably dealt withall, (That bloudy BONNER exceeding euen that monſter of men, NERO, in crueltie) yet ſuch was the good hand of their good God toward them, that ſometimes by fauour which he gaue them with the Keepers, ſom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times by ſtealth, and ſecretly, ſometimes by one
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:257:13"/> meanes, ſometimes by another, they gate pen and inke, notwithſtanding the ſtrait and ſeuere com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandement of the bloudie Butchers to the contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie. Secondly, Gods prouidence alſo herein did ſhew it ſelfe, that would not ſuffer PAVL, ſo skilfull a workman, to be idle, and doe nothing in the buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of the Lord, but would haue a ſupply of his Apoſtolicall preaching made by his writing. The conſideration of this ſhould confirme our faith in Gods prouidence, in our greateſt dangers, and diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culties, euen in the Mountayne, euen in the priſon, nay, out of the priſon it ſelfe, the Lord will make moſt excellent prouiſion for his Church.</p>
                     <p>Againe, it is to be obſerued that S. PAVL doth <label type="milestone">
                           <seg type="milestoneunit">Doct. </seg>3</label> not ſimply call himſelfe priſoner, but with this condition, <hi>of Ieſus Chriſt.</hi> The title of a priſoner in it ſelfe is ignominious; but when he addeth <hi>of Ieſus Chriſt,</hi> all ſtayne of ignominie is cleane wiped a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way. Here hence then we learne, that it is not the <note place="margin">Not the puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, but the cauſe, makes a Martyr.</note> puniſhment, but the cauſe that maketh a Martyr. <hi>Let no man,</hi> ſaith PETER, <hi>ſuffer as an euill doer,</hi> for then what comfort haue we in our ſuffering? but let vs be ſure our cauſe be good, that wee may be able to call our ſelues the priſoners of Chriſt, and then haue we matter of great reioycing, in as much as we are made partakers of Chriſts ſufferings, as PETER ſpeaketh: for he that is the priſoner of Chriſt, hath not only his fellow-Chriſtians, <hi>Heb.</hi> 13. 3. but euen his <hi>Lord Chriſt,</hi> fellow priſoner with him. <hi>Acts</hi> 9. SAVL, SAVL, <hi>why perſecuteſt thou me?</hi> So that now that Chriſt who was impriſoned and perſecuted by
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:257:13"/> SAVL, is now impriſoned and perſecuted in SAVL.</p>
                     <p>But here is not all that wee muſt looke to in our <label type="milestone">
                           <seg type="milestoneunit">Doct. </seg>4</label> ſufferings, that our cauſe be good, but alſo that we <note place="margin">A good cauſe muſt be ſuffered for in a good manner.</note> ſuffer for a good cauſe, in a good manner. The which point is further commended vnto vs in PAVLS example, who was not onely a priſoner of Ieſus Chriſt, but alſo a cheerefull, and couragious priſoner of Ieſus Chriſt: for ſo farre was hee from being aſhamed of his chaine, wherewithall for the hope of ISRAELS ſake he was bound, that he euen gloryeth and boaſteth in it, accounting it farre more honorable, then a chaine of gold about his necke. For whereas PAVL had many titles (a Catalogue of the moſt of them we may ſee, <hi>Phil.</hi> 3. 5.) yet hee leaueth them all for this. Hee ſtileth not himſelfe Citizen of <hi>Rome,</hi> a <hi>Beniaminite,</hi> a <hi>Phariſe,</hi> a Diſciple of learned GAMALIEL, no nor yet which of all o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther is moſt honorable, the Apoſtle of Ieſus Chriſt; but reioyceth rather in this ſtile of <hi>the priſoner of Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus Chriſt,</hi> preferring it before the title of his A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtleſhip, not onely by this mention of his impri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonment, to raiſe vp pitie in the mind of PHILE<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>MON, and ſo to make a way for his ſute that follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth, but alſo hereby to ſhew that he iudgeth it a far greater matter, and more praiſe-worthy, to ſuffer for the Truth, then to preach the Truth; for the gift of ſuffering is preferred before the gift of beleeuing, <hi>Philip.</hi> 1. 23. much more is it then, aboue the gift of preaching, which being a gift incident to caſt-a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes, as to IVDAS, muſt needs giue place to the gift of beleeuing, proper and peculiar to the Elect.
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:257:14"/> Good cauſe haue we therefore with the Apoſtle to reioyce in our ſufferings, as being not only the cog<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nizance and liueries of true Chriſtians, but alſo of ſtrong and tall Chriſtians. Infants and Babes in Chriſt, haue no ſtrength in their backs to beare the burden of Chriſts Croſſe. When therefore wee are called forth into the field, it is a ſigne of ſome ſtrength and Chriſtian manhood, wherewith the Lord hath endued vs. Thoſe Chriſtians therefore which haue reſt giuen them, when many of their Brethren are exerciſed vnder the Croſſe, muſt be ſo farre from cenſuring, and condemning them, in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard of their afflictions, that rather they are to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue a more honorable opinion of them, as being ſuch to whom the Lord hath giuen more ſtrength of grace then to themſelues.</p>
                     <p>Againe, in our ſufferings for Chriſt, here is fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther matter of ioy: That the Lord doth vs a ſpecial credit in them, in that he maketh vs witneſſes of his glorious Truth to the whole world. In this regard, <hi>Acts</hi> 5. the Apoſtles being ſcourged, reioyced, in that they were counted worthy to ſuffer any thing for Chriſt.</p>
                     <p>In theſe and many other reſpects, hauing ſo great cauſe of cheerfulneſſe in the Croſſe: let vs accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to PAVLS example in this place, in a holy kind and manner, bragge and boaſt of them, thinking the <hi>markes of our Lord Ieſus, which wee beare about in our bodies, Gal.</hi> 6. 17. to be no greater deformities to vs then wounds, and a disfigured face with the loſſe of eye, or noſe, are to the valiant Souldier, who ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:257:14"/> gotten them, fighting in defence of his Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trie, accounteth them ſpeciall ornaments, witneſſes of his valour and manhood.</p>
                     <p>Laſtly, we are to obſerue in PAVLS example the <label type="milestone">
                           <seg type="milestoneunit">Doct. </seg>5</label> dutie of all the Miniſters, namely, to make good <note place="margin">Miniſters muſt be ready to make good their prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching by the priſon.</note> their preaching by the priſon, if need be, their ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings by their ſufferings. O baſe is that libertie, yea baſer then the baſeſt bondage, which is got by flin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching from that Truth, which wee haue preached and profeſſed.</p>
                     <p>True it is, that all Chriſtians, by vertue of their calling, are called to ſuffering. <hi>Matth.</hi> 16. 24<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and 1. <hi>Pet.</hi> 2. 21. <hi>Vnto this are yee called, for Chriſt hath ſuffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red for you:</hi> he was our priſoner and captiue for our ſakes: why then ſhould any thinke much to be his priſoner, who ſuffered for vs the loſſe of libertie, and life too? But the Miniſters in more ſpeciall ſort, euen by vertue of their miniſterie, are called to theſe ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferings. <hi>Coloſſ.</hi> 1. 24. PAVL hauing ſaid, that he ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered afflictions for the Churches ſake, in the 25. <hi>Verſe</hi> addeth, as giuing a reaſon thereof, <hi>Whereof I am the Miniſter.</hi> So, 2. <hi>Tim.</hi> 2. 3. <hi>Thou therefore, as a good Souldier, a good Miniſter, ſuffer affliction.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>The reaſon hereof is plaine; Euery Miniſter is the Churches ſeruant, and the end of his miniſterie is to build vp the Church in the truth of the Goſpel, which he cannot doe, vnleſſe being called thereto, he be ready to ſeale the Truth, euen with his bloud. If hee will not thus abet and iuſtifie his owne Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine, he giueth cauſe to the Church to doubt, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther that be the Truth which he hath taught; yea,
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:257:15"/> in truth he deſtroyes that which hee hath built, and vndoes all that hee had done formerly. But of this point more afterwards.</p>
                     <p>Thus much of the firſt perſon writing, the prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipall writer, PAVL. The ſecond, and inferior writer is TIMOTHEVS, deſcribed by the title of PAVLS brother. We are not to thinke that TIMOTHY had any hand at all in the writing of this ſame Epiſtle; but onely becauſe a force vnited is the ſtronger, PAVL takes him into the ſociety of this Petition to PHILEMON, together with himſelfe. So that TI<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>MOTHY did only conſent to this Petition of PAVL, hee did not helpe him in the penning of it, nor no man elſe, onely the holy Ghoſt. This example of TIMOTHY, willingly ioyning with PAVL in this ſo Chriſtian a buſineſſe, muſt teach vs without any ſticking, freely and frankly to lend our helpe to any that ſhall demand it for the furtherance of any good, and honeſt cauſe.</p>
                     <p>TIMOTHYES ſtile here, is PAVLS <hi>brother.</hi> Elſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>where he calleth him <hi>his ſonne,</hi> as hauing conuerted him: here his <hi>brother,</hi> in regard of the communion of the ſame office with himſelfe in preaching the Word.</p>
                     <p>Thereby teaching vs, how louingly affected each to others the Miniſters of the Word ſhould bee, whereof more afterward.</p>
                     <p>Theſe be the perſons writing. The perſons writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten to follow.</p>
                     <p>Firſt, the <hi>principall,</hi> whom this letter more ſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally concernes, the Gouernours of ONESIMVS.
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:257:15"/> Firſt, his Maſter PHILEMON. Secondly, his Miſtris APPHIA.</p>
                     <p>PHILEMON is deſcribed, firſt, by the adiunct of PAVLS loue, <hi>our beloued:</hi> ſecondly, by his calling, <hi>our fellow-worker.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Firſt, hee is called <hi>beloued,</hi> an argument that hee was one that loued God. Otherwiſe that of IEHV ſpoken to IEHOSAPHAT, might haue beene ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plyed to PAVL, <hi>Wouldeſt thou loue them that hate the Lord?</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Let vs learne by PAVLS example, to haue our hearts inlarged in all true Chriſtian loue towards the children of God.</p>
                     <p>Secondly, hee is called PAVLS <hi>fellow-worker.</hi> Whence it may probably be gathered, that this PHILEMON was a Miniſter of the Word. Though it cannot be denyed but that this title may be giuen, not only to men, but euen to women themſelues, as to PRISCILLA, <hi>Rom.</hi> 16. 3. for all Chriſtians are fellow-labourers in ſeeking GODS glorie and the common good of the Church. Though yet in that place PAVL ſeemeth to reſpect in that title ſome ſpeciall ſeruice, which AQVILA and PRISCILLA had done for him. Therefore BEZA well tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lates it, <hi>My helpers,</hi> for ſo the word ioyned with a Genitiue caſe, is oftentimes taken. But yet moſt pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly this title belongeth to thoſe that are of the ſame ſpeciall calling with our ſelues. I will not ſtand here to ſhew that the office of a Miniſter is a worke, and that the Miniſter muſt be a labourer, not a loy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terer, though (I feare) there be a number of idle
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:257:16"/> bellies now adayes, who may well call one another fellow-loyterers, but rather I obſerue,</p>
                     <p>Firſt, the humilitie of PAVL, who though an A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtle <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> in the higheſt degree of the miniſterie, <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 
                        <label type="milestone">
                           <seg type="milestoneunit">Doct. </seg>
                        </label> 4. 11. 1. <hi>Cor.</hi> 12 28. yet diſdayneth not to mate and yoke <note place="margin">Humility of Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters.</note> himſelfe, not only with the Euangeliſt TIMO<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>THY, an inferior degree, but euen with an ordinary Paſtor PHILEMON, who was yet of a lower place then TIMOTHY. How ſweetly doth hee practiſe his owne precept, <hi>Rom.</hi> 12. <hi>Make your ſelues equall with them of the lower ſort?</hi> whereas now many are ſo farre from this, that they euen ſcorne and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dayne their equals, making an inequality where God hath made a paritie; well is it if thoſe that are a great deale their betters, may haue the account of equals. The Apoſtle ſaith, <hi>When I was as a child, I ſpake as a child,</hi> and euery way behaued my ſelfe thereafter, familiarly conuerſing with my fellowes. But many nowadayes, though in truth but chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, yet diſdaynfully caſt off the company and fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miliarity of children, climbing higher, and vnde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cently placing themſelues in the ranke of tall and perfect men.</p>
                     <p>Art thou a Paſtor? ſpeake and doe as a Paſtor to thy fellow-Paſtors, and not as though thou wert an Apoſtle, or Euangeliſt. PAVL, an Apoſtle, equals with himſelfe an ordinary Paſtor; and now, behold, a great difference. Ordinary Paſtors doe not only equall themſelues with, but euen aduance them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues aboue Apoſtles and Euangeliſts, taking more vpon them then euen they did.</p>
                     <pb n="23" facs="tcp:257:16"/>
                     <p> Secondly, I obſerue the cauſe of PAVLS loue to <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> PHILEMON, by the coniunction of theſe two things together, <hi>beloued and fellow-worker.</hi> The latter is the cauſe of the former, therefore was PHILEMON be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loued of PAVL, becauſe his fellow-worker in the miniſterie.</p>
                     <p>Note then, that thoſe that are ioyned together <label type="milestone">
                           <seg type="milestoneunit">Doct. </seg>
                        </label> in the ſame Calling, ought in this regard more <note place="margin">Thoſe that are ioyned in voca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, ſhould be ioyned in affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction.</note> dearely to loue one another. True it is, that the ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerall calling of a Chriſtian ſhould be a ſufficient bond, to knit together in true loue the hearts of all Chriſtians. But when to this bond there commeth a ſecond of our ſpeciall callings, our hearts ſhould be more firmely and faſtly knit together, that ſo it might appeare, that when our hearts ſhall be linked together by the bond of nature, or Chriſtian and ſpeciall calling, that a threefold cord is not eaſily broken. But where ſhall wee find this ſweet con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iunction of beloued, and fellow-worker? In the moſt men the Prouerbe is verified, <hi>Figulus figulo in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uidet;</hi> One Potter enuies another. But farre be this enuy from al Chriſtians of what calling ſoeuer, ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially of the Miniſterie. The Miniſters muſt loue together as Brethren, and with one heart and hand giue themſelues to the Lords buſineſſe. Farre bee from them the mind of the Monopoliſts, that they ſhould goe about to ingroſſe the Word of God to themſelues: nay rather, with MOSES let them wiſh that all Gods people were Prophets. Chriſt taught his Diſciples, who themſelues were Labourers in his Harueſt, to pray the Lord to ſend foorth
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:257:17"/> Labourers into his Harueſt, <hi>Matth.</hi> 9.</p>
                     <p>The ſecond principall partie, to whom PAVL more ſpecially writes, is the other head of the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mily, APPHIA, PHILEMONS wife, who hath the ſame title of beloued giuen her with her husband.</p>

                     <p>PAVL did not thinke it fit for the husband to take a ſeruant into the family, againſt his wiues con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent. And this is the reaſon why APPHIA, though a woman, is ſet before ARCHIPPVS, not onely a man, but a Miniſter, becauſe ſhee had more to doe in this matter, being a Miſtris in the family, then he, who, (as it may not vnprobably bee coniectured) boorded only with them.

A great bleſſing of God to his children, when they ſhall be thus equally yoked, ſo that the Church ſhall haue cauſe to acknowledge them both and to loue them both.

                     <p>Thus much of thoſe parties, to whom princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pally PAVL writes.</p>

                     <p> Firſt, ARCHIPPVS, of whom mention is made, <hi>Col.</hi> 4. He was one of the Miniſters of that Church, and as it ſeemeth, dwelt with PHILEMON. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore PAVL writes alſo vnto him concerning this priuate buſineſſe, as being next to the Gouernours of the Houſe; a principall member therein, in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard of his calling. He therefore, by that credit and authoritie which he had with PHILEMON and AP<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>PHIA, might much further this cauſe.</p>

As ſoone as euer Chriſt was inſtal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led into the Office of his Doctorſhip, he was led by the Spirit into the Wilderneſſe, to encounter hand to hand with this enemie: For how ſhall he be able to relieue the tempted, who himſelfe is wholly vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>experienced in temptations? It is therefore wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thily ſaid, That Prayer, Reading, Meditation, and Temptations, make a Diuine. Therefore PAVL, 2. <hi>Cor.</hi> 12. 7. was buffeted by this enemie.</p>

<pb n="27" facs="tcp:257:18"/> being principall Souldiers, euen the Stan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derd-bearers in this Spirituall Armie, Sathan will moſt fiercely rage againſt them, not onely in his owne perſon, but in his wicked Imps, enraging their malicious affections and ſetting them on fire with the fire of Hell. As then the good Captaine muſt not flye when the enemie comes, but ſtand to it, and fight it out, otherwiſe he betrayes the Army; ſo muſt the faithfull Shepheard keepe his ground, and not ſtirre anynch, for feare of this enemie. O, ſay ſome Miniſters, if wee doe ſo, wee ſhall receiue dangerous wounds, our mouthes ſhall be ſtopped, wee ſhall be impriſoned, &amp;c. What of all this? know they not, that they are Souldiers, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, that it is a part of their Office to ſuffer Afflicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, as well as to preach the Goſpell, though in truth their very ſuffering is a reall preaching to all that heare of it? Therefore S. PAVL ſaith of himſelfe, <hi>Eph.</hi> 6 20.

Our wills being ſo contrarie to the will of God, will not ſo eaſily yeeld, but will hold out as long as they can, kicking and ſpurning againſt the Miniſters. But the Miniſter like a good Souldier muſt plant the great Ordnance of legall
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:257:19"/> menaces againſt theſe high walls, and though it be long ere he ouercome, yet, which is a propertie of a good Souldier, &amp; ſo of this Spirituall Souldier too, 2. <hi>Tim.</hi> 2. 24, 25. hee muſt patiently hold out his ſiege, and not breake vp, if they yeeld not at the firſt.</p>
                     <p>This is the Conflict of this Spirituall Souldier. Now his Victorie; which is excellently deſcribed, 2. <hi>Cor.</hi> 10. 4, 5, 6. conſiſting of two parts.</p>
                     <p>Firſt, the Victorie ouer <hi>the Elect,</hi> who are taken <note place="margin">2. <hi>in Victorie, and that</hi> 1. <hi>ouer the Elect.</hi>
                        </note> captiue, and made willingly to ſubiect themſelues to Ieſus Chriſt, againſt whom formerly they fought vnder Sathans banner. <hi>Wee cast downe</hi> (ſayth the Apoſtle, 2. <hi>Cor.</hi> 10.) <hi>Holds and euery high thing that is exalted againſt the knowledge of God, and bring into captiuitie euery thought to the obedience of Christ.</hi> O, this is a noble Victorie, and theſe are noble Warri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ors indeed, who can ſubdue the rebellious wills of men, and tame their affections. Other Warriors may ſubdue the outward man, but they cannot o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uercome the ſtout heart, that will rebell ſtill in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardly, euen then when the outward man perforce is conſtrained to obedience. Now if he be a vali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ant Souldier that can get victorie ouer his owne af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections, yea, farre more valiant then he that win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth a Citie, as SALOMON witneſſes, <hi>Prouerb.</hi> 16. 32. How valiant a Souldier is he then, who can obtaine this victorie ouer other mens affections? CAESARS and ALEXANDERS victories are nothing compara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to this glorious conqueſt, which the Miniſters get in the hearts of men, when they conuert them.</p>
                     <pb n="29" facs="tcp:257:19"/>
                     <p> Secondly, part of the Victorie is ouer <hi>the repro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bate,</hi> 
                        <note place="margin">2. <hi>Ouer the Reprobate.</hi>
                        </note> who are quite killed with the ſpirituall Sword, and becauſe they wil not bend, are broken to pieces. Of this the Apoſtle ſpeaketh in the ſame place, <hi>Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing vengeance readie againſt all diſobedience.</hi> Thus doth the Miniſter play the Souldier in the Field.</p>
                     <p>Hee reſembleth alſo the Garriſon Souldier: For <note place="margin">2. <hi>In the Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſon.</hi>
                        </note> after that he is returned home victorious from the Field with his Captiues, now become ſworne Soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers of Ieſus Chriſt, the Deuill and the World not enduring the leaſt feather to be pluckt from off their wing, will be ſure to make aſſaults vpon them, for the regaining and recouering out of his hands thoſe men which he hath taken Captiues. As there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore before, he was armed with offenſiue Weapons in the Field, wherewith hee oppugned Sathan and his Armie; ſo now, though returned home glorious in victorie, yet muſt not ſit downe and reſt him, as though all were now diſpatched, but on with his defenſiue Weapons, that he may be able to main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine and hold his owne. Hence it is, that the Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſter is compared to a <hi>Watchman ſtanding on the top of a Tower,</hi> to ſee if he can deſcrie any enemies comming againſt the Citie, <hi>Hab.</hi> 2.</p>
                     <p>And herein firſt of all conſiſteth the ſecond part of the Miniſters Souldierſhip at home, namely, in hauing a wakefull eye, to diſcerne euen the clouds of danger euen ariſing a far off; &amp; thereupon to giue warning. Secondly, hauing ſo done, which is the halfe-arming of his people, according to the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerbe (fore-warned, fore-armed) hee muſt fortifie
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:257:20"/> and make them ſtrong againſt the power of the Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerſaries: firſt, by inſtructing them how to carrie themſelues, how both to weare and how to vſe that complete Harneſſe of the Chriſtian Souldier. Thus like a good Captaine doth he traine his Souldiers, teaching their hands to fight, and fitting their fin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers for the Battell. Secondly, by praying for them; wherein hee playeth the valiant Souldier indeede, combating and conflicting with the Lord God himſelfe. This is called ſtanding in the Gappe, and making vp of the Hedge, <hi>Ezech.</hi> 22. 30. Looke as the wiſe and prouident Martialliſt will ſee where the Citie is weakeſt, when the Walls are any thing decayed, and will bend his Forces moſt of all to fortifie that place, knowing the Enemie will be ſure to take the aduantage of that place, for his more ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſie entring vpon them: ſo likewiſe doth the faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full Miniſter conſider with himſelfe, where the ſinnes of the people haue moſt weakened them, and made any breaches in their Walls, any gappes in their Fence, for Gods iudgements to run in vpon them, and there doth hee make vp the Breach, and ſtand vp in the Gappe; as the Magiſtrate by exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuting Iuſtice and Iudgement, in the example of PHINEES, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 106. 30. ſo hee, by earneſt pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and calling vpon the Name of the Lord, in the example of AARON, <hi>Numb.</hi> 16. 47.</p>
                     <p>And thus we ſee wherein the Souldierſhip of the Miniſter conſiſteth. Let vs now ſee the vſe of this Doctrine. The vſes are two; firſt, to the Miniſter; ſecondly, to the People.</p>
                     <pb n="31" facs="tcp:257:20"/>
                     <p> The vſes, reſpecting the Miniſters, are firſt gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall, ſecondly, ſpeciall. Generall are theſe.</p>
                     <p>The firſt vſe is that, which PAVL maketh to TI<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>MOTHY, <label type="milestone">
                           <seg type="milestoneunit">Vſe </seg>1</label> 2. <hi>Tim.</hi> 2. 4. who hauing compared the Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſterie to a Warfare in the third Verſe, inferreth in the fourth, <hi>No man that warreth, intangleth himſelfe with the things of this life, that he may pleaſe him who hath choſen him to be a Souldier.</hi> A man that is preſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed out for a Souldier, muſt take his leaue of all o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther his affaires and buſineſſes, and giue his atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance vpon his Generall. Then is it no time for him to goe make Bargaines, to exerciſe Trade and Traffique. So muſt it be with the Miniſters; They muſt attend vpon this Spirituall Warfare wholly; this will altogether take them vp: They cannot be troubling and buſying their hands with Ciuill Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faires, and fighting the Battailes of the Lord, at once. The Souldier being preſſed out, accounts himſelfe as it were no man of this World, he will make his Will, ſet his Houſe in order, and takes his farewell of Friends, Wife, and Children, and all, as not knowing whether euer he ſhall ſee them againe, or no: So ſhould the mindes of all Chriſtians, but ſpecially of Miniſters, bee abſtracted from the World, and wholly deuoted to heauenly Medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations.</p>
                     <p>Secondly, Since euery Miniſter is a Spirituall <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> Souldier in the Armie, yea, one of ſpeciall place, that hath many other inferiour Souldiers vnder his charge; all then that enter into this Calling, muſt ſee, that they enter furniſhed with thoſe Spirituall
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:257:21"/> Weapons which PAVL ſpeakes of, able to caſt downe mightie Holds, and that they be able skil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully to handle thoſe Weapons, both for offence and defence. This giueth a ſhrewd checke to many in the Miniſterie, whoſe hands the Lord neuer taught to fight his Battailes. Are not theſe men guiltie of the bloud of the Lords people, who take vpon them to be their Captaines and Conductors, and yet haue no skill at all in managing of Martiall affaires?</p>
                     <p>Againe, other there be, who come not naked and wholly vnarmed into the Battaile; nay, they come clad with very glorious and glittering Harneſſe to the outward eye, but in truth they were as good al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt, if not altogether, be wholly vnharneſſed: Thoſe I meane, who come to this Spirituall War<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fare with carnall Weapons; who come to encoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter with GOLIAH with SAVLS Harneſſe, and not with DAVIDS Sling; with the blunt Sword of meere humane eloquence of the words of men, Philoſophers, and Fathers onely, and not with the ſharpe two-edged Sword of the Word of GOD. Well, our Weapons muſt be proportioned to our Warfare; our Warfare is Spirituall, our Weapons therefore muſt be Spirituall.</p>
                     <p>Thirdly, Since the life of a Miniſter is the life of <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> a Souldier, Miniſters muſt learne to make account before-hand of a toyleſome and troubleſome life. What paines doth the Souldier vndergoe? how hardly liueth hee? lodging on the bare ground, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed to all the iniuries of Wind and Weather;
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:257:21"/> withall, hee carrieth his Soule continually in his hand. Many thinke, the liues of Miniſters are faire and eaſie; they get their liuing with ſpeaking a few words. So true is the Prouerbe, <hi>Warre is ſweet to the vnexperienced.</hi> But, if being in the roome of ſome faithfull Miniſter, they had felt but the halfe of their burden, they would ſing another ſong. Let none therefore dreame of an eaſie and pleaſant life in this Vocation, ſo be it hee meane to be conſcionable in diſcharge of his dutie: no; let him before-hand caſt the worſe, and examine himſelfe, whether he be able to goe thorow the brunts and agonies of this Spirituall Warfare; let him ſay to himſelfe as Chriſt ſaid to the ſonnes of ZEBEDEVS, Am I able to be baptized with that Baptiſme a Miniſter muſt be baptized with; to drinke of that Cup hee muſt drinke of? Aſſure thy ſelfe, that it is farre harder with the Miniſters, the chiefe Souldier, then with common Chriſtians, the inferiour: Though in our Warres, the common Souldier commonly goes by the worſe; but the caſe is otherwiſe here. The Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters ſtanding in the fore-front of the Battaile are in great danger; withall, Satan bends his force moſt againſt them, thorow their ſides ſtriking indeed at the whole Church; for when once the Shepheards ſhall be ſmitten, the Sheepe eaſily will be ſcattered. Therefore Satan ſaith to all of his hoaſt, as once the King of <hi>Aram</hi> to his men; <hi>Fight</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>neyther a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt great nor ſmall, but only againſt the King of Iſrael.</hi> So Sathan; Regard not ſo much common Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans, fight ſpecially againſt their Guides and Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taines.</p>
                     <pb n="34" facs="tcp:257:22"/>
                     <p> Theſe be the generall Vſes. Now alſo from this Doctrine, That the Calling of a Miniſter is a Spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall Warfare, ariſe many ſpeciall Vſes, reſpecting the Miniſters. Wee ſaw the ſpecialls wherein the Miniſters are to ſhew themſelues Souldiers; thence then Miniſters muſt take notice of ſundrie ſpeciall Duties.</p>
                     <p>Firſt then, ſince they are Souldiers, they muſt not thinke it ſtrange, or take any diſcouragement, if ſometimes Satan be let looſe vpon them, to beat them blacke and blue with his temptations; if the World alſo rayſe vp perſecution againſt them: for they are Souldiers, and therefore they muſt looke to haue enemies to fight withall. If then we be diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>graced and irreſpectiuely vſed at the worlds hands, let vs not like cowardly Souldiers leaue our ſtation, and yeeld to theſe enemies. Nay, wee muſt know, it is a part of our Calling, as well to wreſtle with Perſecutions, in ſuffering, as with the wills and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections of men, in Preaching. And when we ſhall be hindered from diſcharge of the latter, by being called to doe the former, wee muſt know for our comforts, we are in a moſt proper worke of our Cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling, which is, to be Spirituall Martialliſts.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. One ſpeciall part of our Warre being with the ſtubborne and ſtiffe-necked wills and affections of ſinners, if ſo be, that after long warring with them, ſtill they remaine iarring and ſnarling at the Word preached, ſo that with the Prophet wee may ſay, <hi>All the day long haue I ſtretched forth my hands to a rebellious and gainſaying people;</hi> let vs not faint
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:257:22"/> in our ſpirits, and deſpaire wholly of victorie; for why? wee are Souldiers. And will an Armie of Souldiers leaue a beſieged Citie, if they conquer it not preſently? No; but they will ſtay a long time, enduring much hardneſſe, as ſome haue done tenne yeeres together, and will not giue ouer their Siege, till they haue ſubdued it. Wee the Spirituall Soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers in like manner laying ſiege to the blind vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding, the way ward will, and crooked affections of ſinfull men, though at the firſt they hold out, ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king their parts good againſt vs, yet muſt wee not hereupon breake vp our Siege; but ſince the iſſue of the Battaile is in the Lords hands, wee muſt therefore, as PAVL willeth, patiently expect, <hi>if the Lord will at any time giue them repentance,</hi> and cauſe them to yeeld themſelues as Captiues to vs his men of Warre. Euen as the Fiſher-man, to whom alſo wee are reſembled, though he hath caught no fiſhes all this day, will yet for all that come againe to mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row, and ſee if he can haue better ſucceſſe.</p>
                     <p n="3">3. The end of all the Souldiers Warring, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Victorie ouer his enemies, the Miniſter of the Word muſt here take notice of the time and right end which they muſt propound to themſelues in their Miniſterie, namely, <hi>Victorie.</hi> But what Victo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie? Not thine owne; that thou mighteſt winne the Garland, and carrie away the prayſe of a fine Prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cher. If wee propound this end to our ſelues, wee are not faithful Souldiers to our Generall and grand Captaine, CHRIST IESVS. As thoſe Souldiers who ſeeke the enrichment of themſelues with
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:257:23"/> ſpoyle, and not the common good of the Countrey, are vnfaithfull to their Countrey. As hee then is a good Souldier, who ſeekes the victorie of his King, to bring thoſe againſt whom he fights, to ſubiection vnto his owne King<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and ſo to make them fellow-ſubiects as himſelfe: So likewiſe here that Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter is a good Souldier of IESVS CHRIST, who aymes onely at this, that CHRIST IESVS may get the victory, and reigne in the hearts and conſciences of his enemies. His victorie, and not our owne, muſt be the end of our Miniſterie, euen if it may be, that quiet and peaceable victorie, which is obtained without bloud-ſhed, the enemies ſubmitting and reſigning themſelues into the hands of the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queror: for the end of other Warre, ſpecially this Spirituall Warre, is Peace, euen the peaceable and flouriſhing Kingdome of CHRIST, eſtabliſhed in the Conſcience. But if this peaceable Victorie can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be obtained, then the bloudie Victorie muſt be the end of our Warre: According to that, LVKE 19. <hi>Thoſe mine enemies which would not haue me reigne ouer them, bring them and ſlay them be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore me.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Miniſters therefore muſt not be afraid to execute the Vengeance PAVL ſpeakes of, vpon the obſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate, and to ſtab them at the very heart with the threatnings of the Law; knowing, that the end of their Miniſterie is as well this violent Victorie o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer the Reprobate, in cruſhing them to pieces as a Potters Veſſell, as the peaceable Victorie ouer the Elect, in captiuating them vnto CHRIST.</p>
                     <pb n="37" facs="tcp:257:23"/>
                     <p> In both theſe victories doth the Lord equally account them his faithfull Souldiers; vnto him they are alwayes a ſweet ſauour, as well when they are a ſauour of death vnto death vnto the wicked, as when they are a ſauour of life vnto life vnto the godly, 2. <hi>Cor.</hi> 2. 15.</p>
                     <p n="4">4. The part of a good Souldier, being as well to defend and keepe that which they haue won from their enemies, as to win it, the Miniſters muſt here take notice of another dutie, carefully to fence and fortifie thoſe Holds and Caſtles, which they haue won from Satan, for though he be diſpoſſeſſed, yet, as it is in the Goſpell, hee will labour to reenter. And oftentimes it falls out, by the negligence of many Miniſters, that they quickly loſe that which they were long in getting. Haue we then gayned a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny vnto the Lord? O how carefull an eye ſhould we haue ouer ſuch, that Satan ſteale them not from vs? how wee ſhould ply them with continuall in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructions and exhortations? As the Apoſtles did, writing to thoſe Churches, that they had planted. How earneſtly ſhould they ſtriue in their prayers for them, that ſo they may be able to ſay the words of our Sauiour? <hi>Iohn</hi> 17. <hi>Father, I haue kept thoſe that thou haſt giuen me, not one of them is lost.</hi> Thus much for the Miniſters. The vſe of this Doctrine to the people is:</p>
                     <p>Firſt, to let them ſee what eſtate they are in na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turally, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> namely, in a moſt miſerable and wretched condition, profeſſing open enmity to Ieſus Chriſt, and fighting vnder Satans banner againſt him. So
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:257:24"/> farre are they from hauing any diſpoſition of them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues, to come and ſubiect themſelues to Chriſt, that they reſiſt and rebell againſt him and his Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters. Therefore are the Miniſters called Souldiers, becauſe they wage warre with vs, labouring to ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>due vs to Chriſt: of thy ſelfe therefore thou com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meſt not to Chriſt, but the Father, by the hands of his Miniſters his Souldiers, as it were by force of armes, muſt draw thee. This ſtriuing and ſtruggling of the Miniſters with vs, muſt cauſe vs to ſee and lament our owne naturall oppoſition againſt God. If we were willing of our ſelues, what needed they ſo Souldierlike to fight with vs?</p>
                     <p>Secondly, ſince the Miniſters are Gods Soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> that doe beſiege the Caſtle of our hearts, wee muſt all learne, not to ſtand out againſt them, but to yeeld our ſelues willingly into their hands; for be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Gods Souldiers, they haue his power aſſiſting them in fighting this battaile; and if we yeeld not in time, but like thoſe ſtiffe-necked and vncircum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſed Iewes, <hi>Acts</hi> 7. continue reſiſting the holy Ghoſt, we ſhall find that the Spirit of the Lord will not alwayes ſtriue with vs, but in the furie of his anger will euen grinde vs to powder. If we will not ſuffer them to obtayne a peaceable victorie, they will get a bloudie victorie: for theſe Souldiers al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes returne with the victorie, if<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> not peaceable, then bloudie; if not in conuerting, in confounding vs; if not taking vs aliue, and making vs the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iects of Chriſt, in ſlaying vs, and making vs the foot-ſtoole of Chriſt. If the ſword of the Spirit
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:257:24"/> pricke not thy heart, as thoſe men, <hi>Acts</hi> 2. and cauſe thee in compunction to come and fall downe at the feete of theſe ſpirituall Souldiers; it ſhall bee ſheathed in thy bowels, and made drunken with the bloud of thy ſoule, and the venemous darts of the Almightie ſhall ſticke in thy ribs for euer. This is the ſecond death, this is the vengeance which Gods Miniſters haue ready againſt diſobedience.</p>
                     <p>If thou be wiſe, therefore hold out no longer, o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen the doore of thy heart, beſieged by theſe ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall Souldiers, and entertayne into the ſame the King of glorie, for hee is mighty in battaile; and if thou yeeld not willingly, while peace is offered, and his Embaſſadours beſeech thee to bee reconciled, hee will hew and hacke thee in pieces, and make thee fuell fit to feed the flames of that eternall fire: He will quaſh thee with his yron rod, as it is in the ſecond <hi>Pſalme.</hi> And therefore as it is in the words following: <hi>Be wiſe now, O yee Kings, &amp;c. Kiſſe the Sonne,</hi> ſubiect your ſelues to him, leſt he teare you in pieces. If <hi>Ieruſalem</hi> will not be gathered vnder Chriſts wing, her habitation ſhall be left deſolate. O thou graceleſſe man, who haſt held out in oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition againſt the Miniſterie, beſieging the Caſtle of thy heart a long time, and haſt not yet reſigned and giuen it vp, behold thy fearefull danger, heare the Lord, ſaying, as once in the old world, <hi>Geneſ.</hi> 6. <hi>My ſpirit ſhall not alwayes ſtriue</hi> with this Rebell. Yea ſee him proportioning his wedge to the timber, and becauſe thou wilt not yeeld, ready prepared to blow thee vp with the Gun-powder of his fearefull indignation.</p>
                     <pb n="40" facs="tcp:257:25"/>
                     <p> Thirdly, ſee how much wee are bound and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holding <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> to the Miniſters, who are content to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priue themſelues of many comforts, and commodi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties of this life, to attend this laborious warfare, and all for our ſakes: ſhall this ſeeme a ſmall thing in our eyes? no, if there be any goodneſſe, it will cauſe vs with al reuerence and reſpect to acknowledge them that be ouer vs in the Lord, for this their workes ſake; withall it will cauſe vs earneſtly to deſire at the Lords hands the continuance of them, know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that the want of them is a farre more grieuous iudgement, then the want of other Warriors, which yet is threatned as a grieuous iudgement, <hi>Eſa.</hi> 3. If they goe, farewell all. Who then ſhall fight the bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tailes of the Lord? who then ſhall goe in and out before the Lords people? who ſhall ſtand vp in the gap in the euil day? Then may we crie after them, as once ELISHA after ELIAS, <hi>Our Fathers, Our Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, the Chariots and Horſemen of Iſrael.</hi> Thus much of the firſt perſon, whom this Epiſtle leſſe con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cernes, <hi>viz.</hi> ARCHIPPVS. The ſecond followes in theſe words.</p>
                     <div type="part">
                        <head>And the Church that is in thy houſe.</head>
                        <p>HEre ſome vnderſtand that Company of the Chriſtians, that vpon the Sabbath met toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, for diuine ſeruice, in PHILEMONS houſe; for in thoſe times they had not the libertie of publike meetings: but, I like their interpretation better, who thinke that in theſe words, PAVL more ſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:257:25"/> meant PHILEMONS owne Family.</p>
                        <p>But why ſhould PAVL write to them? what had <label type="milestone">
                              <seg type="milestoneunit">Obiect. </seg>
                           </label> they to doe with this matter? Cannot a Maſter take a ſeruant into the Family, but hee muſt call his ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uants to counſell? this were to make them quarter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maſters with himſelfe.</p>
                        <p>Firſt, PAVL knew well enough, that whatſoeuer <label type="milestone">
                              <seg type="milestoneunit">Anſw. </seg>
                           </label> he wrote, being penned by the inſtinct of the Spirit, was for the profit and benefit of the whole Church, and euery member thereof, though written by him to ſome one particular man, or Church. Therefore he might well inſcribe theſe his Letters, euen to the ſeruants of PHILEMON, that they alſo together with their Maſter, might reape ſome good by the reading of them. Hence PAVL willeth the <hi>Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loſsians,</hi> that that Epiſtle which hee wrote to them, ſhould be read in the Church of the <hi>Laodiceans.</hi> And PETER telleth the Iewes, 2. <hi>Pet.</hi> 3. that that which PAVL had written to the <hi>Romanes, Rom.</hi> 2. concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning the long ſuffering of God, hee wrote to them, <hi>As our beloued brother</hi> PAVL <hi>wrote to you.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>Secondly, another cauſe may bee this. PAVL knew that it was a matter of no ſmall moment, for fellow-ſeruants to be well affected each to other. If therefore that former euill opinion, which they had iuſtly conceiued of ONESIMVS, did ſtill continue in their minds, this Epiſtle read of them, would make them to be of another mind. Otherwiſe, the other ſeruants ſeeing ONESIMVS, a thiefe and fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gitiue, in fauour with their Maſter, as well, if not more then themſelues, might take it indignely, as
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:257:26"/> the prodigals elder brother did the intertaynment, which his father gaue him, <hi>Luk.</hi> 16. What ſaith he? Thou neuer didſt halfe ſo much for me that haue li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued honeſtly with thee at home, as thou haſt done now for this riotous Spend-thrift, that hath conſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med thy goods vpon whores So. in like manner might the mouthes of PHILEMONS other ſeruants be opened againſt him: Wee haue beene faithfull ſeruants vnto thee thus long, and neuer broke out into any miſdemeanour, and yet, loe, thou prefer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſt before vs this pilfering Purloyner, that hath ſtolne thy goods, and runne away from thee. But this Letter of PAVL would not onely ſtop their mouthes, thus opening themſelues againſt PHILE<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>MON, but alſo open both their hearts and mouthes to entertayne and embrace ONESIMVS, with all courteſie and kindnes, and to performe mutuall du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties towards him, as to their fellow-ſeruant: hereby it may appeare how carefull PAVL was, that the peace ſhould not be broken in one Family. How much more ſtudious ought we to be of the publike peace of the whole Church, euen purſuing after it, in caſe it flie from vs!</p>
                        <p>But here chiefly we are to obſerue, that PHILE<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>MONS<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Family hath this honorable name <hi>of the Church</hi> giuen vnto it. Which argueth as the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendable care of PHILEMON, in the gouernment of his Family, ſo likewiſe the Religion and godli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of the whole Family.</p>
                        <p>Hence then wee learne what kind of Families <label type="milestone">
                              <seg type="milestoneunit">Doct. </seg>
                           </label> Chriſtians ſhould haue, namely, ſuch as might be

                        <p>How may a Family come to deſerue this title? <label type="milestone">

                        <p>For this purpoſe many things are required, <label type="milestone">

                           </label> whereof ſome are <hi>common</hi> to all in the Family, o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, <hi>proper</hi> to ſome.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Common</hi> to all, are theſe two points. Firſt, if we <note place="margin">1. <hi>A platforme of houſhold go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uernment.</hi>
                           </note> would haue our Families <hi>Churches,</hi> then we that are members in Families, muſt labour to become true members of the Church: for a company of profane men is not the houſe of God, but a Den and Dun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geon of Theeues, Adulterers, Atheiſts, conſpiring together againſt God. The which yet is not ſo to be vnderſtood, as if the name of a Church could not be attributed to a Family, in which there are ſome not members of the Church, for euen in the Church it ſelfe there are ſome in it that are not of it. ADAMS houſe, <hi>Geneſ.</hi> 4. is called the face of God, in which CAIN, a caſtaway, was borne and brought vp: for e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uery denomination is from the worthier part. We call the commixtion of Water and Wine, by the name of Wine, though haply there be more Water. Wherefore, if there ſhall be but two righteous per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons found in a Family, we will afford it the honor of this name. But how much more then may that Family challenge the name of a Church, in the which there ſhall not be ſo much as one <hi>Canaanite,</hi> and vncircumciſed perſon? In which all the mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers of the Family ſhine moſt brightly, as Gemmes
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:257:27"/> and Diamonds, to the great grace of the whole Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mily. Let therefore euery one of a Family be deſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous, the houſe he dwels in, ſhould be <hi>Bethel,</hi> Gods houſe, bring one ſtone to the making of this ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall houſe, that ſo hee may bee able to ſay, This houſe is a holy edifice, and I am one of the liuing ſtones that helpe to the making of it ſo.</p>
                        <p>This is that which DAVID prayeth for, in the behalfe of the poſteritie of the <hi>Iſraelites,</hi> that they might be Corner-ſtones, poliſhed and grauen to make a Princely Palace: for howſoeuer that houſes may be Gods Temple, in which there are many vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poliſhed ſtones, vnfit for the making of GODS Temple, yet they, as much as in them is, depraue it of this honorable ſtile. Neither doth any part of this holy praiſe of the Church of God, in a Family, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long to thee, who being in the Family, art a mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of the Church malignant. A ſpot thou art, and blot in the Family, and being an vngrauen and vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>carued ſtone, marreſt the grace of the whole buil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding: for the grace of a building is a ſweet vniformi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie and agreeableneſſe of one part with another. But this vniformitie is quite ſpoiled by this defor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitie; who being no other kind of ſtone then thou waſt in the quarry, canſt not ſort, nor ſute with thoſe ſtones, which the art and skilfull finger of the holy Ghoſt hath formed and faſhioned aright, hath fined and fitted to be liuing ſtones to make a ſpirituall Temple. It is a goodly ſight to ſee a long traine of men, all in one liuery; but one among them of an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other liuery, daſhes all the ſightlineſſe. So the good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:257:27"/> ſight that otherwiſe would be in this building, is exceedingly diſgraced, when theſe mis-ſhapen and vnfaſhioned ſtones, are ioyned with the moſt artifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciall ſtones, whereon God himſelfe hath beſtowed his moſt exquiſite workmanſhip. If then euery ſoule in the Family will be one of theſe ſtones, the Family will not only be a Temple, but a moſt glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious and beautifull Temple. Now though this du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie be common to all, yet in more ſpeciall ſort it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longeth to the Heads of the Family, who are, as it were, the corner ſtone of this little Temple, in their owne Family.</p>
                        <p>Secondly, that a Family may obtayne the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendation of being a <hi>Church,</hi> this is another thing that we require generally of al in the Family name<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, that looke what kind of men they are, or at leaſt would ſeeme to be in the Church, and publike Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregation, the ſame they would ſhew themſelues to be in the Family, and priuate conuerſement one with another. Now all make ſhew of Religion in the Church: therefore if that the markes and foot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteps thereof ſhall be ſeene alſo, as well within the priuate walls of the Family, then ſhall thoſe walls be the walls alſo of Gods Temple. If our Families ſhould be ſtraightly examined by this rule, in many of them, yea, moſt of them, ſooner ſhould we find Satans Court, then Gods Houſe. For hee that ere-while in the Temple ſounded forth with a lowd voice, the praiſes of God, in the Church, is ſcarſe at the Church doore, but hee belcheth forth moſt beaſtly and bloudie blaſphemies. O how much
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:257:28"/> changed from that man, which euen now he was in the Church! Thus, out of the ſame Fountayne, commeth both ſowre and ſweet; ſweet in the Church, ſowre in the houſe; bleſſing in the Church, curſing and curſed ſwearing in the Family. In the Church alſo, what ſhew of humilitie make wee, ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſting downe our ſelues at Gods foot-ſtoole, and confeſſing our owne vileneſſe? In the Family, as though wee had left all matter of humiliation be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hind vs in the Church, how proudly, and inſolent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, how ſcornefully and diſdaynfully carry wee our ſelues one to another? In the Church alſo, what ſemblance make wee of brotherly loue, friendly comming together into one place, and with one conſent ioyning together as one body in Gods ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uice? But in the Family by daily contentions and brawlings, how doe wee rend and teare our ſelues one from another. In the Church, by our very comming thither, wee make faire pretence of per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forming obedience to all the Doctrines ſhall be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liuered, but in our priuate life wee euen tread and trample them vnder our feet. Thus are they Deuils incarnate in their owne houſes, which will needs ſeeme Saints, yea, petty gods in Gods houſe. When then there is ſuch a diſcord and jarring betwixt our Church-life and Family-life, how can we looke our Families ſhould be called or counted Churches?</p>
                        <p>Theſe be things common to all: now follow <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> thoſe <hi>peculiar</hi> to ſome: firſt, to the chiefe: ſecond<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, the inferiour. Thoſe things which reſpect the chiefe, are ſpecially theſe: firſt, As much as in them
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:257:28"/> lyes, let them entertayne none into their Family, whom God hath not firſt entertayned into his. Let them take none into their houſe, which is not of the houſhold of Faith; herein ſhall our Families no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tably reſemble the Church. The Church doth not indifferently receiue all, and admit into her ſocietie by the Sacrament of Baptiſme, the children of <hi>Turks</hi> and <hi>Canibals,</hi> ſtrangers from the Couenant, but one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſuch ordinarily as are of a holy Seede, the off<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpring of religious Parents. So likewiſe muſt our Families, if we would haue them like Churches, be ſomething daintie who<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> they receiue. They muſt not be common receptacles for euery one that wil offer themſelues: for we ſhewed before, that if we would haue our Families enioy this name and praiſe of a Church fully and without ſpot, that all the mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers thereof, for ought we know, be true members of the Church. Therefore Maſters of Families muſt prouide them of ſeruants, not onely ſuch as may be ſeruiceable vnto them, and fit for their do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meſticall employments, which is that, which moſt doe only regard, but eſpecially ſuch as doe truely feare God. Otherwiſe thy houſe is a cage of vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleane birds, yea, a Stye and Stable of Swine, rather then Gods Temple, wherein an Altar is erected to him. Therefore DAVIDS example is to be imita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 101. whoſe <hi>eyes were vnto the faithfull of the Land,</hi> that he might picke euen the choiſeſt of them for his ſeruice, and that ſo much the rather, becauſe farre more eaſily may wee keepe out, then caſt ſuch gheſts out of our houſes.</p>
                        <pb n="48" facs="tcp:257:29"/>
                        <p> Secondly, The chiefe in the Family muſt reſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble the chiefe in the Church, namely, the Paſtors, &amp;c. thereof; and that not onely in thoſe things which concerne Gods Seruice, but outward Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipline alſo.</p>
                        <p>For the firſt. There are two ſpeciall Duties of the Paſtor, reſpecting Gods Seruice, Preaching and <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> Praying. In both theſe, in ſome meaſure, ſhould the Gouernours of the Family be like to the Paſtors of the Church.</p>
                        <p>Firſt therefore, they muſt inſtruct the whole Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mily in that Doctrine which is according to Godli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe.</p>
                        <p>This they muſt doe, firſt, in Words; which PAVL commandeth, <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 6. and which God him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe commendeth in ABRAHAM, <hi>Gen.</hi> 18. And leſt any ſhould ſay, ABRAHAM was a Prophet, and that his Practice may not be exemplarie to priuate men, <hi>Deut.</hi> 6. 6. all Maſters of Families are charged with the ſame dutie. Where alſo, leſt they ſhould pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend for excuſe, the dulneſſe of their children and ſeruants, to conceiue the inſtructions; they are com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded to ſet an edge vpon them, and to deliuer them piercingly. Married wiues alſo are bound to the ſame dutie, in the example of BATHSHEBA, <hi>Prou</hi> 31. nurturing yong SALOMON; and EVNICE training vp TIMOTHY from a child in the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures. For in that excellent character and deſcripti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the good Huſwife, <hi>Prou.</hi> 31. this is one thing, <hi>That ſhee openeth her mouth wiſely, and the Law of Grace is vnder her lippes.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <pb n="49" facs="tcp:257:29"/>
                        <p> Here then is cenſured that gouernment of the Family, which is onely Ciuill, not Religious. When Maſters giue charges to their ſeruants for their houſe-hold buſineſſes, they can ſet edges vpon them, by often repetitions, and threatnings: with their children alſo they can ſport and play; but not one word of Gods Word. They referre them whol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly for that to the Miniſterie; the which profiteth lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle, vnleſſe this preparation of priuate inſtruction goe before. So wee read, that IAAKOB <hi>ſanctified his Family, before they went to Bethel, Gen.</hi> 32. and IOB <hi>his ſonnes, before the Sacrifices.</hi> Therefore PAVL ſendeth Women to their Husbands at home, to learne, whom haply their careleſſe Husbands had referred ouer to the Miniſter. Aſſuredly, if the Word of God ſound not in thy houſe, as in the Church, it is vnworthie the name of a Church?</p>
                        <p>Secondly, they muſt teach likewiſe by example: With DAVID, walking in the vprightneſſe of their hearts in the middeſt of their houſe: for the eye of the whole Family is vpon the Gouernours thereof, as is the eye of the Church vpon their Paſtors.</p>
                        <p>Secondly, As in Preaching, ſo likewiſe in Pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> muſt they imitate the Paſtors; <hi>for the Houſe of God is called the Houſe of Prayer.</hi> If therefore this principall part of Gods ſeruice be wanting in any houſe, how can it be called Gods Houſe? Theſe things are not yet ſo tyed to the Heads of the Family, but in greater Families, the multitude of buſineſſes, concurring with the multitude of per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:257:30"/> therein, they may, as ABRAHAM, <hi>Gen.</hi> 24. haue their Deputies.</p>
                        <p>Thus muſt they be like the Paſtors in things con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning Gods ſeruice.</p>
                        <p>Secondly, they muſt reſemble them in their Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipline, cauſing their houſehold Diſcipline to be anſwerable to the Church Diſcipline.</p>
                        <p>That this thing may be done, theſe things are required:</p>
                        <p>Firſt, That which is the ground of all good Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipline, they muſt haue a verie watchfull and atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiue eye ouer euerie ſoule in the Family; ſo that they may know the ſeuerall natures, conditions, and diſpoſitions of all, and ſo proportion their go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uernment accordingly. This is rightly to play the Biſhop; who hath that name, from his carefull o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerſeeing of the Flocke, <hi>Acts</hi> 20. 20. For the good Paſtor will not reſt in a generall care of his Flocke, but hee will heedfully marke and obſerue euery particular Sheepe, and ſo know of what hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour and ſpirit they be, and ſo likewiſe take no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice of thoſe which are diſeaſed. Therefore <hi>Ioh.</hi> 10. 3. the good Shepheard is able to call all his Sheepe by their names.</p>
                        <p>If then thou wouldeſt haue thy Family like a Church, thou that art Chiefe therein, muſt be like thoſe that are Chiefe in the Church, in hauing this prying and obſeruing Epiſcopall eye; ſo that eue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie ones manners, ſpeeches, actions, and whole courſe and carriage may be thorowly marked.</p>
                        <p>This IOB practiſed notably; inſomuch, that his
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:257:30"/> ſonnes, though men growne, and dwelling apart from him, could not yet banquet among them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues, but ſuch was his vigilant eye ouer them, he knew of it preſently, and withall vſed meanes to vnderſtand what was done and ſpoken at the Feaſts; which thoſe his words argue, <hi>It may be my ſonnes haue blaſphemed;</hi> that is, Albeit I can finde out nothing done amiſſe, yet it may be, they haue done ſome euill which I know not of, neyther yet could poſſibly come to the knowledge of, for all my obſeruation.</p>
                        <p>But now adayes, Children and Seruants may feaſt, and runne about hither and thither, if not without the priuitie and knowledge of their Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents and Maſters, yet without their obſeruing of them, and their demeanour, at ſuch times. This is the Fountaine and Originall of moſt Diſorder in Families. This vigilant Eye is wanting, which ſhould walke through all the corners of the Houſe, and ferret out Naughtie-packes, going about miſ<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>chiefe. Too much truſt is giuen to other mens eyes. They will ſee and heare all with other mens eyes and eares; forgetting the Prouerbe, <hi>The eye of the Maſter fatteth the Horſe.</hi> It is this diligent and circumſpect eye of the Maſter that fatteth the Houſe too, and makes it haue the goodly face of a Church. Therefore it is SALOMONS Precept, <hi>Prou.</hi> 27. 23. <hi>Take heed to thy Heards, and know the eſtate of thy Flocke.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>If SALOMON would haue men thus carefully, with their owne eyes, looke to their owne Sheepe;
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:257:31"/> brutiſh creatures; how much more to the ſoules of their ſeruants, the Sheepe of Ieſus Chriſt, bought with his bloud? Are they not much more worth then Sheepe?</p>
                        <p>Secondly, After that the Eye hath layd theſe foundations, the Hand muſt build thereon.</p>
                        <p>Firſt, As ſoone as it hath receiued warning from the Eye of ſome euill that is in brewing, in ſtretching forth it ſelfe, and arming it ſelfe to hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der it, and keepe the authors thereof within their bounds. For this purpoſe, both Admonitions and Threatnings muſt be vſed, but eſpecially, whole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome Lawes muſt be enacted, for the prohibiting and preuenting of things vnlawfull. For ſo, in times paſt, the Apoſtles, and now, the faithfull Paſtors, doe ſtill meet with thoſe euills which are approching towards the Church. Wherefore, as in the Church and Common-weale, ſo likewiſe in the Family, euill manners muſt occaſion good Lawes.</p>
                        <p>By the which, the way being hedged vp againſt all Wickedneſſe and Diſorder, a ſweet Order and comely Conuenience, the very life of euery Socie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie, may flouriſh, and ſo cauſe an image of the Church to be ſeene in the Family. For it is the Precept of the Apoſtle, concerning the Church, That all things ſhould be done there in Order and Comelineſſe; for <hi>God is the God of Order, and not of Confuſion.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>O the ſweet and faire face of that Family, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in by vertue of good order, euerie member ſhall be
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:257:31"/> kept in tune and temper. Certainely, no Harmo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie ſo melodious and pleaſant to the eare, as this ſight is acceptable to the eye. The Queene of <hi>She<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baes</hi> eare was not ſo much affected with the wiſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome of SALOMON, as a liuely Oracle ſounding in his Family, but her eye was as much rauiſhed with the beholding of that ſeemely order and me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thod obſerued of all in his houſe. And this latter is noted to be the cauſe of that her admiration and exclamation, as well as the former. And ſure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, vnleſſe there be a reſemblance of Church-diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipline in the gouernment of the Family, as of Doctrine in the inſtruction thereof, though there may be an Image of the Church, yet a very darke and obſcure one, much deformed and defaced, not able to delight the eye of the Queene of <hi>Sheba.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>In ſuch Families therefore, where the Guides haue no care to maintaine this order, that euerie man may know his place, and doe that which is required of him by vertue thereof, but the reines are let looſe to euerie man, to doe as he will, there is an image rather of Hell, and of that confuſed Chaos at the beginning of the Creation, of that <hi>Cyclopicall</hi> Ataxie, of that <hi>Iſraeliticall</hi> Anarchie, <hi>Iudg.</hi> 17. when euerie man did that which was good in his owne eyes; of any, or all of theſe, rather then of a well-gouerned Church. In the which, as there be diuers Officers; ſome ſuperior, ſome inferior; ſome, Paſtors and Teachers; ſome, Elders and Deacons; ſome, that are vnder the care and gouern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:257:32"/> of theſe Officers: ſo, they all carrie themſelues according to their places, for the good of the whole Bodie. And thus, not the leaſt ſtring being out of tune, what an heauenly Harmonie will this be?</p>
                        <p>According to this frame let our Families be fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhioned, that there be a due <hi>Decorum</hi> kept and ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerued of all; a comelineſſe of ſubiection, as PAVL requireth, 1. <hi>Tim.</hi> 3. in the inferiors; a comelineſſe alſo of commaunding and ruling in the ſuperiors: And what then ſhall let, but ſuch a Family may bee baptized with the Name of CHRISTS CHVRCH?</p>
                        <p>Secondly, The ſame hand which made the Sword of good Lawes, for the preuention of euill to come, muſt draw it out, for the puniſhment of euil paſt, and not ſuffer it to lye ruſting in the ſheath. If then any ſhall breake thoſe good Lawes which the Gouernors of the Families haue made, let the puniſhments threatned be inflicted; that ſo, thoſe who would not obey the Precepts of the Law, may perforce be conſtrayned to obey the threatnings thereof.</p>
                        <p>Now herein muſt there bee an imitation of Church-Diſcipline. Looke then, as in the Church the offendor is firſt admoniſhed diuers times, and at length not profiting by thoſe admonitions, is ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>communicated and dis-ſynagogued: ſo likewiſe in thy Family finding wicked and vngodly ones, firſt muſt thou deale with them by admonition, repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>henſion, caſtigation; and if for all theſe meanes, they ſtill remaine incorrigible, then caſt them out of
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:257:32"/> thy houſe, and thinke their roome better then their companie. If ISMAEL and HAGAR become Scof<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fers, out of doores with them, ſend them packing preſently; off with the rotten members, leſt the ſound ones be infected with their contagion: for how ſhall thy houſe be Gods Garden, when ſuch roots of bitterneſſe grow in it; in the which, not ſo much as barren Trees may be ſuffered to cumber the ground? Till thy Family be purged of ſuch, it is more like a Wood and Wilderneſſe, full of bram<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles and bryers, then the faire and pleaſant <hi>Eden</hi> of the Lord. Therefore DAVID, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 101. ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemnely vowed, before he came to be King, to the intent, that his owne Court might be Gods Court, That hee would diſplace and moue out of it all wicked ones, euen thoſe who onely did but giue ſuſpition by their lookes and countenance of wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kedneſſe.</p>
                        <p>If then, contrarie to that which once ELIPHAZ aduiſed IOB, wee ſhould graunt <hi>vnto Iniquitie har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour and habitation</hi> in our houſe, thinke wee, that God would cohabitate? No; hee is of pure eyes, and cannot behold iniquitie. How can we thinke our houſes, being full of Hogges and Dogges, to be fit for the entertainment of that great and mightie King of Kings? Firſt, driue theſe out of doores; otherwiſe, God will not vouchſafe thy houſe the honour of caſting his eye vpon, much leſſe of entring into and dwelling in it; God and wicked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe are inſociable, they will not abide vnder the ſame Roofe together.</p>
                        <pb n="56" facs="tcp:257:33"/>
                        <p> If the King were to come to thy houſe, and there were ſome in it he could not abide, wouldeſt thou not diſcharge them thine houſe, if ſo be thou wert deſirous of the Kings preſence? And entertaining Traitors in thy houſe, Traitors againſt God, thinkeſt thou, that he will come and pitch his Tent, and take vp his Lodging with thee?</p>
                        <p>Theſe be the things proper to the Chiefe. Now follow thoſe which belong to the inferiors; in the which, as in the former, their Gouernors reſembled the Paſtors of the Church, they muſt reſemble the reſt of the Bodie of the Church.</p>
                        <p>Firſt, <hi>In matter of Doctrine.</hi> As the Church ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledgeth <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> thoſe that are ouer her, in the Lord, and obeyeth them, 1. <hi>Theſſ.</hi> 5. <hi>Heb.</hi> 13. ſo muſt thoſe that are vnder gouernment, carrie themſelues reue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rently and reſpectiuely towards their Gouernors, cheerefully and conſcionably obeying as all other of their lawfull commaunds, ſo eſpecially thoſe which concerne Gods worſhip. And as by the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample of the Paſtors, the reſt of the Church are ſtir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red vp to godlineſſe, <hi>Phil.</hi> 4. 9. ſo muſt the inferi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ors in the Family be encouraged, and inflamed to vertue, when they ſhall ſee their ſuperiors going be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore them.</p>
                        <p>Secondly, they muſt reſemble the Church in <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> matters of Diſcipline.</p>
                        <p>Firſt, Enduring thoſe Chaſtiſements, either <hi>Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bull</hi> or <hi>Reall,</hi> which for their deſerts are inflicted, and freely acknowledging the equitie of them.</p>
                        <p>Secondly, If at any time they ſee any of their fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowes
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:257:33"/> mis-behauing himſelfe, firſt let them trie what they can doe themſelues by admonition: but if that way they preuaile not, then according to the example of the Eccleſiaſticall Diſcipline, <hi>Matth.</hi> 18. let them acquaint their Gouernours therewithall. Thus IOSEPH told his Father of his brethrens wickedneſſe, <hi>Gen.</hi> 37. and ſome of ISA<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>AKS houſehold, as it ſeemeth, told REBECCA of ESAV, <hi>Gen.</hi> 27. 42. I, but by this meanes wee ſhall get our ſelues ill-will, and be called but pick-thanks and tell-tales for our labour. What then? if by the ſame meanes the Family may be called the Church of God?</p>
                        <p>The vſe of this Doctrine is three-fold.</p>
                        <p>The firſt concerneth your Honors, who I doubt <note place="margin">
                              <hi>To the Lord and Lady</hi> Hairing<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton.</note> not, but according to that wiſdome God hath giuen you, doe account the name of a Church the faireſt ſtile of your Houſe. Certainely, the outward mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nificence and ſumptuouſneſſe of the Building, the pleaſantneſſe of Situation, the coſtly Hangings on the Walls, the rich furniture of Houſehold ſtuffe, the goodly ſhew of tall and proper perſonable Men attending; nay, outward Ciuill Order is nothing, if the name of the Church be wanting. The ſmoa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kie Countrey Cottage of a poore man being godly, ſhadoweth and obſcureth the ſtately and proud Palaces of prophane Princes. Maintaine then this Title that ſtill your Houſe may be <hi>Bethel,</hi> and not <hi>Bethauen.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>The ſecond concerneth you, whom their Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nours haue betruſted with the gouernment of the

                     <p>Firſt, The Ciuilitie and Humanitie of PAVL, in
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:257:35"/> this and all other of his Epiſtles, vſing ſuch kind and courteous greetings. Chriſtianitie therefore is not ſeuere: neither yet clowniſh nor ruſticall, that it ſhould neglect theſe duties of ciuill courteſie in ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luting our Friends and Brethren, either in writing or ſpeaking. Wee ſee how preciſe PAVL is in the obſeruing of this point in all his Epiſtles, and how carefully he ſetteth downe the ſalutations of others alſo ſometimes. The Chriſtians, in the Primitiue Church, had a cuſtom in their meetings in the pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like Aſſemblies, to whetten their ſalutations, as it were, with a kiſſe; which the Apoſtle calls <hi>a holy kiſſe,</hi> not onely allowing it, but alſo commanding it. <hi>Ruth.</hi> 2. 4. BOAZ and his Reapers ſalute each o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, he ſaying to them; <hi>The Lord be with you:</hi> they to him; <hi>The Lord bleſſe thee.</hi> The Angels themſelues haue vſed our formes of ſalutations, <hi>Luk.</hi> 1. Let no man therefore account of them as matters of cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monie and faſhion, but as of a Chriſtian dutie, ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſarily to be performed, vnleſſe it bee in ſome caſes, as when the performance of this dutie of ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutation, may be a hinderance to other farre more neceſſary duties, <hi>Luk.</hi> 10. 4. 2. <hi>King.</hi> 4. 29.</p>
                     <p>Secondly, in this example of PAVLS ſalutati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, <label type="milestone">
                           <seg type="milestoneunit">Doct. </seg>
                        </label> wee may learne what kind of ſalutations ours muſt be, euen holy ſalutations, as being hearty pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, <note place="margin">Salutations muſt be holy, and</note> wherein we craue the greateſt bleſſings that are, at the Lords hands, for the perſons ſaluted: here then are many kinds of ſalutations cenſured.</p>
                     <p>Firſt, the prophane ſalutation of ſwearing Swag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerers <note place="margin">Not prophane,</note> and rude Ruffians, which is not any holy
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:257:36"/> forme or prayer vnto God, but a moſt fearfull tea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring and rending of the name of God in pieces, by moſt horrible Oathes.</p>
                     <p>Secondly, the perfidious ſaluation, ſuch a one <note place="margin">Not perfidious,</note> as IVDAS his was, who betrayed his Maſter with a kiſſe: and IOABS, who cloking his inward malice with ſweet and ſugred ſalutations, moſt villanouſly murthered valiant ABNER, euen in the act of ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luting.</p>
                     <p>Thirdly, the formall and cuſtomarie, and with <note place="margin">Not formall.</note> all nice, curious, and affected kind of ſaluting, when men are ſo full of their ceremonies and comple<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, that they make themſelues fooliſh and ridi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culous. And herein conſiſts all their grace of their greetings, in courting, and congeying, and ducking, and ſuch other geſtures: but that which is the very pith and marrow of a Chriſtian ſalutation, the lif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting vp of the heart to God, in deſiring the welfare of thoſe they ſalute, is wholly wanting. Geſtures in ſaluting are good and commendable, ſo they may ſtand with comelineſſe, and the ſimplicity of Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtianitie. But this is a fault, euen in many, who yet are not ſo fond and ſo full of affectation in their ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutations as others, that in ſaluting their Brethren, with thoſe good and holy formes in common vſe, as, <hi>God be with you, God ſaue you, &amp;c.</hi> they take the holy Name of God in vaine, not hauing their hearts lifted vp to God, whoſe name they call vpon, but only ſpeaking of cuſtome, and ſo not minding what they ſay: A fault in moſt; and it ought to be a matter of humiliation vnto vs, as being an argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:257:36"/> both of the want of feare to God, and loue to our Neighbour. Salutations are Prayers to the Lord, and therefore the name of the Lord muſt with all reuerence be thought vpon, when they are vſed. Some hence take occaſion to neglect this dutie, becauſe they are Prayers, and they thinke it not lawfull to wiſh well in Prayer to euery one wee meete, who ſometimes may haply be going about ſome wicked enterpriſe.</p>
                     <p>But beſides, that Charitie biddeth vs to thinke and hope the beſt in matters of vncertaintie, they ſhould haue remembred that of our Sauiour, <hi>Luke</hi> 10. <hi>Into whatſoeuer houſe yee goe, ſay, Peace be vnto this houſe, and if the Sonne of peace be in the houſe, your peace ſhall come vpon it, if not, your peace ſhall re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turne vpon you.</hi> So then, there is no hurt done whom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoeuer we ſalute, ſo it be not a notorious Heretike, or ſome ſuch offender, not much vnlike, 2. <hi>Ioh.</hi> but if wee ſalute the children of God, wee doe good to them, our ſalutations are effectuall meanes through the bleſſing of God, to bring vpon them the good deſired. If others, we doe good to our ſelues, that good wee deſire to them, ſhall bee granted to our ſelues. The ſumme then of this whole point of ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutation, in a word, is thus much: firſt, that we con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcionably performe this dutie both by word and writing, Superiours to their Inferiours, as well as on the contrary, euen Kings to their Subiects, to ſtrangers as well as to thoſe of our acquaintance, <hi>Luk.</hi> 10. 2. that we doe it in a holy manner, feeling our hearts with reuerence, both affected to God,
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:257:37"/> and inlarged in loue to our Brethren. Thus much in generall.</p>
                     <p>In this ſalutation more particularly, wee are to conſider theſe two points:</p>

                     <p>Therefore, there is a ſecond, and that more pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per ſignification of this word Grace, for the fauour and good will of God, as <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 2. 8. For by grace are yee ſaued through faith. And this is that which here the Apoſtle wiſheth to PHILEMON.</p>
                     <p>Now, this Grace and Fauour of GOD is two<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fold.</p>
                     <p>Firſt<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> that fauour of God whereby he purpoſeth <note place="margin">Two degrees of Gods loue.</note> to make vs capable of his fauour, and fit to be fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uoured of him, when as in our ſelues there was no
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:257:37"/> matter of fauour, but only of diſpleaſure. The gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing of Chriſt vnto vs, and all the benefits which wee receiue in Chriſt, are made fruits and effects of this fauour, <hi>Rom</hi> 5. 15. <hi>Much more the grace of God, and the gift by grace, hath abounded to many.</hi> The gift by grace is iuſtification and reconciliation with God. A man would thinke wee could not be in the loue and fauour of God, till Chriſt had reconciled vs. I, but that Chriſt is giuen vnto vs to be our Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conciler. Whence comes this but of the fauour of God, namely, this firſt kind of fauour, whereby God goeth about to fit and prepare vs for his fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uour? So the Apoſtle directly affirmeth, <hi>Rom.</hi> 5. <hi>God ſetteth out his loue vnto vs, that when we were ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners, Chriſt dyed for vs;</hi> and Chriſt himſelfe, <hi>Ioh.</hi> 3. 16. <hi>God ſo loued the world, that he ſent his only begot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten Sonne:</hi> which is to be vnderſtood of ſuch a kind of loue and fauour, whereby hee is willing, as it were, and deſirous to fauour vs, and not otherwiſe. For how then could wee be ſaid to be reconciled to God by Chriſt, if before wee were actually in the loue and fauour of God? And of this grace our e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lection is made a fruit, <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 1. 5, 6. <hi>Who hath prede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinated vs to the glorie of his grace, whereby hee hath freely made vs accepted in his Beloued,</hi> that is, whereby he hath predeſtinated vs.</p>
                     <p>Secondly, there is another degree of Gods fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uour, when hauing a deſire to fauour vs, and a free diſpoſition to doe vs good, and becauſe it would not ſtand with his Iuſtice to fauour the vile and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bominable, hauing further of his owne good plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:257:38"/> in Chriſt, fitted vs for his fauour, he doth now take a ſingular pleaſure and delight in vs. So then there is a fauour, whereby God makes vs, as I may ſay, fauourable, ſuch as may be fauoured, and it is the deſcription of the Apoſtle himſelfe, <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 1. 6. <hi>By the which grace he hath made vs accepted.</hi> And there is a further fauour whereby hauing made vs accep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, that is, ſuch as may be accepted, he doth indeed accept vs, and is exceedingly well pleaſed with vs. This may be called the <hi>fauour of complacency.</hi> And this is that fauour which ſo often in the <hi>Pſalmes</hi> is called the <hi>light of Gods countenance.</hi> The conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of theſe diſtinct, not kinds, but degrees of Gods fauour, is very neceſſary. For hereby wee ſhall ſee how the death of Chriſt is both the cauſe and the effect of the fauour of God. A cauſe of this latter fauour, an effect of the former: hereby alſo we ſee, how both the fauour of God is merited by Chriſt for vs, and yet free, becauſe it was of the free fauour of God, to vouchſafe vnto vs the merits of Chriſt, for the procuring of his fauour. Now in this place both theſe fauours are meant. So that the full meaning of the Apoſtle, ſaying, <hi>Grace be vnto you from God,</hi> is this: The Lord grant vnto you his fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uour, both that fauour whereby you may be made capable of his fauour in being iuſtified through Chriſt, as alſo that ſweet acceptation of you being thus fitted for his fauour.</p>
                     <p>What need the Apoſtle wiſh vnto them the firſt <label type="milestone">
                           <seg type="milestoneunit">Obiect. </seg>
                        </label> fauour, ſince that was granted vnto them from e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerlaſting, as alſo ſome fruits thereof, namely, their
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:257:38"/> Election in Chriſt, and in time the other fruits there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, their ingrafting into Chriſt, Iuſtification and A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doption?</p>
                     <p>Though God had vouchſafed them this fauour <label type="milestone">
                           <seg type="milestoneunit">Anſ. </seg>
                        </label> before all Worlds, and they by it were made fit to be entertained into his ſpeciall fauour, yet PAVL might pray, that God would continue it ſtill to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards them. For as it was the cauſe of thoſe good things, which makes vs acceptable to God; ſo like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe is it the cauſe of the continuance of them, namely, of Chriſt, and all his Bleſſings, and ſo con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequently, of our Acceptation: for we are readie to forfeit Chriſt and his Righteouſneſſe dayly, and ſo to loſe all that Grace which by his meanes we haue with God. Therefore it is needfull, that ſtill wee ſhould require that firſt degree of Gods fauour to hold out, and be continued towards vs, for the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuation of all other mercies whatſoeuer, which depend vpon it. And in truth, this ſecond fauour being an effect of the former, hee that deſireth the latter, muſt needs withall deſire the former. But, as I take it, both here and elſewhere the word Grace eſpecially is to be vnderſtood of the latter degree of Gods fauour, which is the moſt proper ſignifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation of the Word: as when wee ſay, Hee is in great grace with the King. And that which the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtle addeth, from IESVS CHRIST, declareth the ſame who is the effecter of this ſecond fauour, but an effect of the former. But yet the other Grace is alwayes neceſſarily to be included. Firſt then the Apoſtle prayeth for theſe to whom hee
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:257:39"/> writeth, that God would lift vp the light of his countenance vpon them; and ſecondly, for that purpoſe, becauſe the pure eyes of God cannot be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold iniquitie, ſuch as they were in themſelues, that he would of his free fauour worke and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue that in them, which might draw his ſweet eye towards them, and cauſe him to caſt a gracious and amiable aſpect vpon them.</p>
                     <p>Firſt, from hence let vs obſerue the chiefeſt and <label type="milestone">
                           <seg type="milestoneunit">Doct. </seg>1</label> principalleſt cauſe of Gods fauour to vs, namely, <note place="margin">The cauſe of Gods fauour.</note> his owne free will and gracious diſpoſition to fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uour vs. For though, indeed, Chriſts obedience doe merit the fauour of God for vs, yet there was nothing in vs, to merit at Gods hand that ſo pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious a Treaſure, but it is a free gift of Gods grace; as the Apoſtle notably ſheweth, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8. <hi>Who ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing giuen vs his owne Sonne;</hi> the word ſignifieth to giue <hi>gratis,</hi> and freely. So then, Gods grace be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the cauſe of Chriſt his being giuen, it is alſo the cauſe of that acceptance which wee find with him, through Chriſt: for that which is the cauſe of the cauſe, is the cauſe of the thing cauſed. And therefore Grace is the cauſe of Grace, that is to ſay, Gods owne gracious inclination of his Will to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards vs, to doe good to vs, is the cauſe of that ſo great grace which we find in his eyes. And herein differeth Gods fauour from mans; Mans fauour, though it make him doe good to the partie fauou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, yet firſt of all it preſuppoſeth ſome good in the man fauoured; an attractiue, and drawer of this his fauour. Now Gods fauour, as it is the
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:257:39"/> cauſe of all other mercies wee dayly receiue, ſo is it alſo the cauſe of it ſelfe, as wee ſhewed; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it doth not preſuppoſe any good thing in vs before, but bringeth with it that good thing, name<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, CHRIST IESVS, which muſt vphold and main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine this his fauour.</p>
                     <p>The vſe of this Doctrine, is to humble vs in our ſelues, as hauing not the leaſt ſparke of goodneſſe in our ſelues, and to make vs aſcribe all prayſe and glorie in euerie thing to God, whoſe Grace is the fountaine and foundation of all good things what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoeuer. Let no man then talke of Chriſts merites, and therefore in this regard clayme the fauour of God, and life eternall, as his due. From whence is it, that we haue Chriſts merits imputed vnto vs, and the imputation of them daily continued, but of the free mercie of God? And ſo for all this, the Apoſtle, <hi>Rom.</hi> 3. ſayes, <hi>Wee are iuſtified freely by his Grace.</hi> Though wee are clothed with Bracelets, Iewels, and Ornaments, where withall Gods holy Eye is affected, <hi>Ezech.</hi> 16. yet haue we no cauſe to be proud, for it was God that put vpon vs theſe Robes, when wee were in our ragges and filthie naſtineſſe; and ſo he doth but loue his owne beautie in vs.</p>
                     <p>Secondly, in the example of PAVL, in all his Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutations <label type="milestone">
                           <seg type="milestoneunit">Doct. </seg>2</label> wiſhing firſt of all Grace, that is the fauour <note place="margin">The grace and fauour of God to be deſired aboue all things.</note> of God, we learne what it is that we ſhould chiefely and principally deſire, eyther for our ſelues, or o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, our children, wiues, kindred, fathers and mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, acquaintance, &amp;c. <hi>viz.</hi> this Grace of S. PAVL. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 4. 6. <hi>Many ſay, Who will ſhew vs any good? Lord, lift</hi>
                        <pb n="68" facs="tcp:257:40"/> 
                        <hi>thou vp the light of thy countenance.</hi> And ABRAHAMS wiſh for ISMAEL was, <hi>Oh that</hi> ISMAEL <hi>might liue in thy ſight!</hi> ABRAHAM had goods ynough to leaue ISMAEL, but that contented him not; hee deſired better things for him, That he might be ioint-heire of the gracious Promiſe together with ISAAC.</p>
                     <p>The reaſon why we ſhould thus deſire this Bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing, is ſpecially in theſe two regards:</p>
                     <p>Firſt, Gods fauour is the ground of all other Mercies whatſoeuer: It is the maine and Mother-Bleſſing, <note place="margin">2. <hi>Reaſons.</hi>
                        </note> the very Seed of all other Mercies whatſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>euer; ſo that in deſiring it, we deſire all other; and getting it, we get other. This is the reaſon men ſeek, as SALOMON ſpeakes, after the face of the Ruler, to get into fauour with him, becauſe his fauour is as the latter Raine, and promiſeth a fruitfull Har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueſt of many benefits. Hereupon it is, that thoſe who are in fauour with Princes, preſume ſo farre, and make themſelues ſure of any thing. As HA<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>MAN being asked by the King, What ſhould bee done to the man whom the King in ſpeciall fauour would honour? could anſwere readily, preſuming himſelfe to be the man, by reaſon of his ingraft<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment in the Kings heart; <hi>Let them bring for him Royall Apparell, the Kings Horſe, and Crowne, and proclaime, Thus ſhall it be done, &amp;c.</hi> How much more then, vpon this ground, ſhould wee ſeeke for the fauour and face of God? For what may we not promiſe to our ſelues vpon his fauour? What not ſhall be done to the man whom this great King fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uoreth? <hi>Pſ.</hi> 149. <hi>This honor ſhall be done to his fauorites.</hi>
                        <pb n="69" facs="tcp:257:40"/> For Kings are not able to doe all things as they would, to gratifie thoſe they loue; but God is able to doe for his, euen more then he will doe; his Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er exceedeth his Will. But the will euen of the mightieſt Monarchs oftentimes goeth beyond their power. They want occaſions and oportunities to pleaſure thoſe whom they fauour; yea further, ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny times they are preuented, before thoſe occaſions fall out, by ſudden death: therefore moſt excellent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly the Pſalmiſt, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 146. <hi>Truſt not in mortall Princes,</hi> that is, in their fauour and grace, <hi>for their breath is in their noſtrils, and their thoughts periſh.</hi> They haue many thoughts and purpoſes to aduance ſuch and ſuch: but euen whiles they are in theſe thoughts, commeth the voyce, <hi>Thou foole, this night ſhall they take away thy ſoule from thee;</hi> and then what ſhall be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come of thy thoughts; or what good ſhalt thou, poore man, haue, that truſtedſt in thoſe thoughts? But hee that relyes vpon Gods fauour, ſhall ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer be deceiued, nor diſappointed. Therefore, in the fore-named place, the Prophet addeth, <hi>Bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed is the man that truſteth in God,</hi> Why ſo? <hi>who made Heauen and Earth, the Sea, and all that therein is, which keepeth fidelitie for euer.</hi> Where, beſides the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finite power of God, able to doe all things, a fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther reaſon is added, to make vs bold to build vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on Gods fauor, <hi>viz.</hi> the faithfulneſſe and conſtancie of this his loue: Whom hee loues, hee loues to the end; whereas a mans loue is often a lying loue, like a deceitfull Bow, <hi>Iob.</hi> 9. It giues the ſlip to thoſe that are moſt of all intereſſed in it.</p>
                     <pb n="70" facs="tcp:257:41"/>
                     <p> Let vs therefore giue ouer our too too greedie deſire of the fauour of men, ſpecially great Ones: Let vs labour for Gods grace, and this will bring with it, mans. As it is ſaid of our Sauior, <hi>Luk.</hi> 2. <hi>That he grew in fauour,</hi> firſt, <hi>with God,</hi> ſecondly, <hi>with man.</hi> Therefore DAVID in the fourth Pſalme, though in diſgrace with SAVL, yet prayeth not for the light, of SAVLS countenance, but onely of Gods. And ſo PAVL in all his Epiſtles, though the Churches he writes vnto, were in the diſgrace of the Heathen Emperors, yet ſtill he wiſheth vnto them Grace, not from graceleſſe NERO, but <hi>from God the Father, and our Lord Ieſus Chriſt;</hi> this being the meanes to attaine, as all other benefits, ſo likewiſe this of grace with men. <hi>Prou.</hi> 17. <hi>When a mans wayes pleaſe the Lord,</hi> (and ſo the Lord will be well pleaſed with him) <hi>his very enemies ſhall become his friends.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Secondly, Gods grace is in ſtead of all other bleſſings, in caſe they be wanting. As ELKANAH ſaid to his wife, complaining for want of children; <hi>Am not I in ſtead of tenne Sonnes to thee?</hi> Doth not my loue and husband-like affection, wherewithall I embrace thee, make amends for children? So ſpea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth Gods fauour to all thoſe that haue their part in it; Am not I vnto thee in ſtead of Riches, Friends, Grace and Glorie, and Greatneſſe in the World? Though indeed Gods fauour ſhall not be ſo perfectly and fully all in all, till the life to come, 1. <hi>Cor.</hi> 15. yet euen in this life, in ſome meaſure, it is all in all vnto them ſo, that they crie out with DAVID, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 73. <hi>Whom haue wee in Heauen, &amp;c?</hi>
                        <pb n="71" facs="tcp:257:41"/> As <hi>Manna</hi> was to the <hi>Iſraelites</hi> that Meat which they deſired, whether Fleſh or Fiſh; in this regard are we further to hunger and thirſt after this Grace, and in a holy kind of ambition, ſtriue for this fauor. It will bring exceeding comfort and contentment in all our wants; yea, it will make a through ſupply of all our wants. As God anſwered PAVL, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaining of the pricke of the fleſh, <hi>My Grace is ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient for thee:</hi> Which though we expound of the gifts of Grace and Sanctification; yet wee are to know, that theſe were no otherwiſe ſufficient for him, then as they were fruits, and ſo teſtimonies of Gods fauour.</p>
                     <p>Thirdly, Since whatſoeuer wee deſire, wee are <label type="milestone">
                           <seg type="milestoneunit">Doct. </seg>3</label> likewiſe to ſeeke it, in the vſe of the meanes, PAVL in his example commending vnto vs the deſire of Gods fauour, withall further ſheweth vs, that wee muſt vſe meanes for the attainment of it. True it is, that the firſt fauour of God to whomſoeuer it is, it was before all Worlds, and therefore we can doo nothing for the attainment of it. But that ſecond degree of Gods fauour, though in regard of Gods Decree it was giuen vs before all Worlds too, as <hi>Paul</hi> witneſſeth, 2. <hi>Tim.</hi> 1. 9. yet wee are not actually poſſeſſed of it, till we be called and iuſtified. And though they procure not themſelues (for we main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine againſt the Papiſts, that the grace which makes vs gracefull, is not any inherent grace in our ſelues, but it is the free gift of God in Chriſt) yet at that very time hee beſtoweth this Iewell vpon them, hee ſtirreth vp in them an earneſt deſire, and a propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tionable
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:257:42"/> endeuour after it. It is Ieſus Chriſt, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed, that bringeth vs into fauour with God: yet withall, when the Father giueth vs this gift, hee makes vs alſo vſe meanes not ſo much, indeed, for the attainment of it, as for our owne aſſurance of the attainment thereof.</p>
                     <p>What then are thoſe things which we muſt doe <label type="milestone">
                           <seg type="milestoneunit">Queſt. </seg>
                        </label> for this purpoſe?</p>
                     <p>Firſt, taking thorow-notice of that diſgrace and <label type="milestone">
                           <seg type="milestoneunit">Anſw. </seg>
                        </label> diſpleaſure thou art in with God, and that moſt de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeruedly for thy ſinnes, thou muſt firſt of all come <note place="margin">Three meanes whereby we may attaine to the fauour of God.</note> as BENHADADS Seruants came to AHAB, euen, with a Halter about thy necke, creeping and crou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching before the Throne of Grace; abaſing and ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iecting thy ſelfe at his Footſtoole, in the humble and penitent confeſſion of thy ſinnes. We ſee man being iuſtly offended with vs for ſome iniurie offe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red him, will not vouchſafe vs his fauour, till wee haue humbled our ſelues before him, and confeſſed our fault, witneſſing our vnfained griefe for the ſame. And thinke wee to haue God fauourable vnto vs, who neuer yet were touched with any ſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row for diſpleaſing him, nor in this ſorrow haue proſtrated our ſelues at his feete, with bleeding hearts lamenting and bewayling our offences?</p>
                     <p>Thou then that deſireſt the fauour of GOD, come vnto him with this ſacrifice of a bruiſed and broken ſpirit, and thou ſhalt be accepted, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 51. Thou ſhalt finde the ſaying of the Apoſtle moſt true, <hi>God reſiſteth the proud, and giueth grace to the humble.</hi> This muſt terrifie the impenitent, whoſe
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:257:42"/> hearts will not relent, who ſinne freely and merrily, <hi>Drinking in iniquitie, as the fiſh drinketh in water:</hi> neuer ſaying ſo much, as, <hi>What haue I done?</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Aſſuredly, they are out of the fauour of God. An humbled heart for ſinne is the firſt ſtep to the fauour of God.</p>
                     <p>Secondly, thou muſt ſhrowd thy ſelfe vnder Chriſts wings. Clothe thy ſelfe with his righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe and the precious Robes thereof, that ſo thou mayeſt appeare amiable and louely in the eyes of the Lord, for in Chriſt only is the Father well plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed: and ſo if thou wouldeſt haue him well pleaſed with thee, thou muſt become a member of him, bone of his bone, and fleſh of his fleſh. This thou doeſt, when by Faith thou layeſt hold vpon Chriſts righteouſneſſe, and gripeſt the promiſes of the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpell. And this act of Faith ſheweth it ſelfe moſt of all in earneſt Prayer and Deprecation, when thou cryeſt with ſtrong cryes, <hi>Forgiue me my treſpaſſes. Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the multitude of thy mercies, blot out my of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fences.</hi> Theſe be the wreſtlings of IACOB, who would not let the Lord goe till he had bleſſed him. If thou wouldeſt find grace, thou muſt come, and in this manner knocke at the gate of Grace, and it ſhall be opened vnto thee. How can wee looke to haue grace with God, when he offring vs his Sonne as a meanes thereof, wee will not reach forth the hand of our Faith to take him?</p>
                     <p>Thirdly, by Faith hauing clad thy ſelfe with the Robes of Chriſts imputed righteouſneſſe, thou muſt be clothed vpon with the garment of thy own
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:257:43"/> righteouſneſſe and obedience, which, howſoeuer being in it ſelfe a menſtruous cloth as it comes from vs, yet being of the Spirits owne weauing, in that regard is acceptable to God, and cauſeth him to take a further delight in vs. <hi>Pro.</hi> 3. 3. <hi>Let not Mercy and Truth depart from thee, ſo ſhalt thou haue fauour with God and man.</hi> Pro. 11. 20. <hi>They that are vpright in their way, are his delight.</hi> If then we would be Gods Fauoured and Beloued, we muſt put on that party-coloured Coate of the Apoſtle, <hi>Col.</hi> 3. 12. conſiſting of many parts, <hi>Of Humbleneſſe, Mercy, Kindneſſe, and long Suffering, &amp;c.</hi> then ſhall that be verified, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 45. 11. <hi>The King ſhall delight in thy beautie:</hi> and that <hi>Cant.</hi> 4. 9. <hi>My faire One, thou haſt wounded my heart with one of thine eyes, and with a chaine about thy neck.</hi> Looke how the Spouſe, that being beautifull of her ſelfe, is withall ſet forth and decked with precious ornaments, is gracious in the eyes of her Louer: ſo ſhalt thou be in Gods, when thou appeareſt before him in the beautifull face and pleaſant rayment of a new creature in Chriſt Ieſus, for then thou art made partaker of the diuine Nature. And God in thee ſeeing himſelfe, an Image of his owne Holineſſe and Righteouſneſſe, thou being with DAVID a man after his owne heart: how can hee but take great pleaſure in thee, if ſo bee hee take pleaſure in him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe? Thou then, who haſt not this pleaſant ray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the new man, but the torne rags of the old man, thou that lyeſt wallowing in the mire of ſinne, a forlorne naſty creature, thou that ſtill retayneſt the old <hi>Ethiopian</hi> hide and Black-mores skin, theſe

                     <p>The ſecond followeth, <hi>and Peace.</hi> I doe willing<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly aſſent to thoſe, who by <hi>Peace</hi> doe vnderſtand all proſperitie and felicitie, both earthly and heauenly in this life, and that to come. In the ordinary ſalu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation among the Iewes, wherein they wiſhed peace to the ſaluted, <hi>Luk.</hi> 10. I thinke only outward pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſperitie was meant by peace. But as the Apoſtles augmented the ordinary forme of ſalutation, by ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding Grace to Peace, becauſe they preached in the Goſpell the free Grace of God for our ſaluation, ſo by the ſame reaſon may it well be thought, that they inlarged the ſignification of this word Peace, euen to inward peace, as well as to outward, ſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally their Goſpell, being the Goſpell and glad ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dings of that Peace. Extending therefore the ſigni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication <note place="margin">Foure things comprehended vnder Peace.</note> of this word, in this Apoſtolicall ſalutati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on further, then it was taken in the common gree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tings of the Iewes, it may comprehend all theſe things within his circuit.</p>
                     <p>Firſt, the inward <hi>peace of Conſcience</hi> with God, which ſpringeth out of the grace and fauour of God, <hi>Rom</hi> 51. A mans conſcience will neuer be at quiet within him, till it feele this grace. There will bee nothing there, but the vncomfortable darkneſſe of terrors and aſtoniſhments, till the light of Gods
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:257:44"/> countenance ariſe and ſhine vpon it.</p>
                     <p>Secondly, <hi>The peace of Charitie</hi> among our ſelues, of which the Apoſtle: <hi>Be at peace among your ſelues: Let the peace of God rule in your hearts.</hi> This alſo is an effect of Gods grace, which as it maketh a man at peace with himſelfe and God, ſo with his Brethren.</p>
                     <p>The loue of God ſhed into our hearts, will make vs loue our Brethren alſo: There can be no true loue then among thoſe that are not in fauour with God, but they liue together like Wolues &amp; Beares. But when our God hath vouchſafed vs his grace, he changes our Woluiſh and Tygriſh natures, accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliſhing that which is propheſied, <hi>Eſai.</hi> 11.</p>
                     <p>Thirdly, <hi>The peace of Amitie,</hi> and a holy kind of League with all Gods creatures. <hi>Iob</hi> 5. <hi>The ſtones of the field ſhall be at peace with thee.</hi> This alſo is an effect of grace: for when we haue his fauour, who is the Lord, wee haue the good will alſo of his ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uants the creatures. <hi>Rom.</hi> 8. <hi>If hee bee with vs, who can be againſt vs?</hi> for all things are at his command, who is the Lord of Hoſts. Nay, who ſhall not be for vs? On the contrarie, Oh the miſeries of the man in diſgrace with God! all the creatures are at enmitie and at variance with vs, being out of Gods fauour. The ſenſeleſſe creatures themſelues in their kind riſe vp againſt vs, to fight the Lords battails a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt vs, as the heauens did fight againſt SISERA, <hi>Iudg.</hi> 5.</p>
                     <p>Fourthly, <hi>Outward Proſperitie</hi> and good ſucceſſe in our wayes; ſo it is commonly taken in all their ſalutations, as 1. <hi>Chron.</hi> 12. 18. <hi>Peace be vnto thee,</hi>
                        <pb n="77" facs="tcp:257:44"/> 
                        <hi>O ſonne of</hi> ISHAI. And, 2. <hi>King.</hi> 9. <hi>Is it peace?</hi> the ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutation of IEHORAM to IEHV. Hence it is, euen from this manner of ſaluting, all kind and good dealing is ſet out in the Scripture by this phraſe of <hi>ſpeaking peace,</hi> as <hi>Pſal.</hi> 85. God ſayes, <hi>I will ſpeake peace to my people.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Now, the reaſon why outward proſperitie is ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nified by this name of <hi>peace,</hi> is, firſt, becauſe to the godly they are Pawnes and Pledges of that ſweet Peace they haue with God. Secondly, they are no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table Maintayners of the peace and quietneſſe of our affections; for in the want of outward things how are we diſquieted and vnſettled!</p>
                     <p>But Peace, in this fourth ſignification, is ſo ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken for outward proſperitie, that which all this out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward Proſperitie hath Securitie annexed vnto it, and is a fore-runner and beginning of that eternall Proſperitie and Felicitie in Gods Kingdome; for both theſe things are vnderſtood by the name of Peace. <hi>Securitie, Pſal.</hi> 4. 9. <hi>I will lay me downe and ſleepe in peace:</hi> firſt, ſecurely, and the <hi>perfection of all proſperitie,</hi> in the life to come. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 37. <hi>Marke the iuſt man, the end of that man is peace.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Firſt, from hence obſerue, that as wee may law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully <label type="milestone">
                           <seg type="milestoneunit">Doct. </seg>1</label> deſire for our ſelues and others outward proſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peritie, <note place="margin">We may lawfully deſire outward bleſſings, and how.</note> and the bleſſing of this life, <hi>Giue vs our daily bread,</hi> Petit. 4. <hi>Food conuenient, Pro.</hi> 30. ſo how and in what manner we muſt deſire them.</p>
                     <p>Firſt, hauing deſired grace in the firſt place. <hi>Mat.</hi> 6. <hi>Firſt ſeeke the Kingdome of God:</hi> and then in the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond place we may ſeeke temporall things: but now
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:257:45"/> men are all for peace: <hi>Who will ſhew vs any good?</hi> few or none for grace: peaceable men, as I may call them, enough, very few gracious men that doe firſt of all ſeeke Gods grace, and then in the ſecond place peace.</p>
                     <p>Secondly, in deſiring of outward things, wee muſt moderate our deſires, that they goe not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond their bounds, to deſire abundance and ſuper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluitie of them; for we deſire them by the name of Peace: therefore no more muſt wee deſire, but that which will ſerue vs, to attend the works of our Cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling with free and quiet minds, without diſturbance or diſtraction. Thus AGAR prayed againſt pouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie, and for a competency of outward things, leſt otherwiſe falling into Satans ſnare, hee ſhould take the name of God in vaine. Thus farre may our de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſires goe. And our heauenly Father knoweth wee ſtand in need of theſe things, namely, of a compe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tency of them, as a very neceſſarie helpe for Gods ſeruice.</p>
                     <p>Secondly, againe, PAVL firſt deſiring Grace, and <label type="milestone">
                           <seg type="milestoneunit">Doct. </seg>2</label> then Peace, ſheweth vs that peace, namely, outward <note place="margin">Peace is a fruit of Grace.</note> proſperitie, is a fruit of Grace, and ſo, that the nee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſt and moſt compendious way to get peace, is firſt to get grace and fauour with God. IOSEPH and DAVID had wonderfull ſucceſſe in all their wayes, and the reaſon the holy Ghoſt yeeldeth thereof, is this; <hi>The Lord was with them, Geneſ.</hi> 39. 1. <hi>Sam.</hi> 18. <hi>The way of man,</hi> firſt, of the iuſt man, of whom hee had formerly ſpoken, <hi>is directed by the Lord:</hi> but what is the reaſon hereof? <hi>Becauſe the Lord loueth his</hi>
                        <pb n="79" facs="tcp:257:45"/> 
                        <hi>way:</hi> that is, is well pleaſed with him and his courſe of life, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 37. 23. therefore hee had ſhewed before, how the wicked man borrowes, and payes not a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine, though rich and wealthy, whereas the godly, though poore, is able to lend. And all this, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe as he addeth, <hi>Verſ.</hi> 22. <hi>The bleſſed of the Lord ſhall inherit the Land.</hi> It is the grace and bleſſing of God that is all in all. And as it is the cauſe of good ſucceſſe in the generall courſe of our liues, ſo like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe in euery particular action. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 44. The <hi>Iſrae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lites</hi> victorie ouer the <hi>Canaanites,</hi> is aſcribed, not to Sword or Bow, but to the light of Gods counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance, becauſe hee did fauour them. NOAHS pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeruation in the Floud; MARIES honour to bee Chriſts Mother, giuen to this cauſe, they found fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uour with God. Would we then enioy the comforts of this life? would we proſper and thriue in our en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deuours, and works of our Calling? Labour then for Gods grace and fauour. Grace is the onely meanes to draw on Peace. When wee haue got Chriſts righteouſneſſe, it is that Grace which makes vs gracefull to God: <hi>Matth.</hi> 6. then outward things come voluntarie, as it were, &amp; of their owne accord, without our ſeeking or deſiring: no maruell then if oftentimes things goe croſſe with vs, wee by our ſinnes hauing drawne downe the curſe of God vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on all our enterpriſes. This is the reaſon why Gods children liue better, euen with greater credit and reputation in the world with a little, then many times the wicked doe, which haue farre more. Gods bleſſing ſets forward the one, and his curſe blowes vpon the other.</p>
                     <pb n="80" facs="tcp:257:46"/>
                     <p> But we oftentimes ſee thoſe that are not in grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſt <label type="milestone">
                           <seg type="milestoneunit">Obiect. </seg>
                        </label> fauour with God, abounding with theſe earthly bleſſings. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 17. <hi>The men of this world, whoſe bel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lies thou filleſt and fatteſt with the hid treaſures of the earth.</hi> And on the contrarie, thoſe that haue grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſt ſtore of Grace, to haue a very ſmall pittance of Peace.</p>
                     <p>Firſt, <hi>For the godly,</hi> who hauing their part in <label type="milestone">
                           <seg type="milestoneunit">Anſw. </seg>
                        </label> grace, haue alwayes in ſome meaſure their portion in peace alſo: for <hi>firſt,</hi> The end of all his afflictions, whereto they are diſpoſed, is peace. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 37. <hi>The end of the iuſt man is peace.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Secondly, He hath the <hi>peace of Securitie</hi> in his grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſt diſtreſſes. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 3. 6. <hi>I laid mee downe and ſlept, and roſe againe, becauſe thou, Lord, ſuſtaynedſt me:</hi> and <hi>Pſal.</hi> 4. 9. <hi>I will ſleepe in peace.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Thirdly, He hath the <hi>peace of Contentation,</hi> Grace ſupplying and ſweetning the want of Peace, and turning very Warre it ſelfe into Peace, darkneſſe in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to light to the godly, his heart is at reſt and at peace within it ſelfe.</p>
                     <p>There is no warring of the affections againſt God, whatſoeuer his outward eſtate is. Therefore, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 37. <hi>A little to the righteous, is more then great riches to the wicked: for, godlineſſe is great gayne, bring<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing contentation.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Secondly, <hi>For the wicked.</hi> It is farre otherwiſe with them in their peace, which being a graceleſſe peace, a peace not founded on grace, is in truth a peaceleſſe peace, for in the middeſt of their peace they want the <hi>peace of Securitie,</hi> their hearts tremble
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:257:46"/> like an Aſpen leaſe, in feare of change; or if they haue ſecuritie, it is a preſumptuous and falſe ſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritie; for when they crie, <hi>Peace, Peace, then is their deſtruction at hand,</hi> 1. <hi>Theſſ.</hi> 5. 3. And let their Peace be neuer ſo flouriſhing, yet ſtill want they the <hi>Peace of Contentation;</hi> they thinke all too little: if they had the whole World, with ALEXANDER, they would grieue there were no more for them to get. Againe, as the end of the godly mans Warfare is Peace, ſo the end of the wicked mans Peace, is Warfare, euen an eternall Warfare, and wreſtling with the anger of God in Hell. Therefore a ſound and ſafe Peace ariſeth onely from the Grace of God. The Peace of the wicked deſerueth not the name of Peace: <hi>There is no Peace, ſayth my God, to the wicked, Eſa.</hi> 57.</p>
                     <p>Thus much for the things deſired. Now let vs ſee from whom they are deſired: firſt, <hi>from God the Father;</hi> ſecondly, <hi>Chriſt Ieſus our Lord.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>The Holy Ghoſt is not here excluded, though not named. But in all actions of God, reſpecting the creatures, when one Perſon is named, the reſt are to be included.</p>
                     <p>By God, being here oppoſed to Ieſus Chriſt, wee are to vnderſtand the firſt Perſon; who is cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led our Father, not onely in regard of Creation, <hi>Luk.</hi> 3. ADAM <hi>the ſonne of God, Heb.</hi> 12. <hi>the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of Spirits;</hi> but alſo, and eſpecially, of adopti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on in Chriſt: And that to this end, that as wee might hence aſſure our ſelues, that God will euery way carrie himſelfe as a Father to vs, ſo wee ſhould
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:257:47"/> teach our ſelues the behauior and dutifull diſpoſiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of good ſonnes towards him.</p>
                     <p>But here more ſpecially marke, what is the cauſe <label type="milestone">
                           <seg type="milestoneunit">Doct. </seg>
                        </label> of Gods fauour, namely, God himſelfe. Grace, the fauour of God, be vnto you, from God. It comes not then from any thing in our ſelues; from any fore-ſeene workes, or worthineſſe of ours. But of this more before.</p>
                     <p>The ſecond Author of this Grace and Peace, is IESVS CHRIST.</p>
                     <p>Firſt, He is the Author of Grace, of both de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees: of the firſt degree of Grace, as God; of the ſecond, onely as God-man, as Mediatour.</p>
                     <p>Some of the Papiſts, who teach, That the Grace making vs gracefull, is the gift of Regeneration in vs, doe yet acknowledge the firſt degree of Gods fauour to be of himſelfe, who of his owne free fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uour giues vs this gift, whereby according to them he maketh vs worthie of his fauour. But here we learne, that as the firſt degree of Gods fauour, ſo likewiſe the ſecond, is not of our ſelues. Firſt, the Apoſtle ſayth, <hi>Grace be to you from God.</hi> I, but they might ſay, How ſhould we come to be gracious in Gods eyes? PAVL therefore addes, as ſhewing the meritorious cauſe of Gods fauour, <hi>and from Ieſus Christ:</hi> He ſayes not, and from the habite of Regeneration.</p>
                     <p>CHRIST IESVS then is the Grace that makes vs gracefull: Hee hath all the Grace of God; Hee is euen full of it, and of his fulneſſe wee receiue our ſhare of it. The fauour of God lights vpon
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:257:47"/> Chriſt, and then from him it is deriued to vs. It is not any thing in thy ſelfe, that can draw the gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious eye of God towards thee. Saint PETER com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands vs to <hi>truſt perfectly in that grace which com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mends vs to God,</hi> 1. <hi>Pet.</hi> 1. but wee may not truſt in a creature, as is any infuſed habit of grace. Therefore we muſt abandon all other things, and cleaue onely to Chriſt, by whom onely wee haue acceſſe to the Throne of Grace.</p>
                     <p>Secondly, he is the Author of Peace. Euen out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward things themſelues come to vs by Chriſt, wee loſt our right vnto them in ADAM, and wee recouer it not but in Chriſt.</p>
                     <p>Firſt then we learne, that the true Chriſtian is the <note place="margin">True Chriſtians only true owners</note> only right owner of Peace. All others are but vſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pers, for theſe outward things are appendances of Chriſts righteouſneſſe, and are entayled thereto, <hi>Matth.</hi> 6. 33.</p>
                     <p>Secondly, we are taught to vſe all the bleſſings of <note place="margin">How outward bleſſings muſt be vſed.</note> this life, Chriſtianly, moderately, and thankfully, for they are purchaſed for vs with no leſſe price then the bloud of Chriſt. And when we exceed in the vſe of any outward comfort, meate, drinke, ſport, &amp;c. wee are iniurious to the bloud of Chriſt, as though, by it, were purchaſed for vs a lawleſſe libertie, for licentiouſneſſe, wantonneſſe, and drun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kenneſſe, &amp;c. Chriſts bloud hath bought vs right to the moderate vſe of all comforts: if we goe fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, we goe beyond our right, and vſurpe vpon the creature. This checketh thoſe that vſe vnlawfull re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creations, or lawfull, vnlawfully: for our outward
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:257:48"/> peace is to be receiued from Chriſt, as the Author thereof.</p>
                     <p>Oh that we could thinke of this, when the crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures preſent themſelues vnto vs, though not to keepe our ſelues wholly from the vſe of them, as DAVID did, from drinking that Water which his three Worthies brought him, becauſe it was the Water of Bloud; yet from the abuſe of them, in Gluttonie, Surfetting, and Drunkenneſſe, becauſe they are the bloud of Ieſus Chriſt! and by the eye of faith we muſt behold the bloud of Chriſt ſwimming in euery diſh that comes to the table. This is the onely ſawce to ſweeten our meat, and all other out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward comforts whatſoeuer: for we may with good conſciences vſe them, when we can receiue them as fruits of the bloudſhed of Chriſt. And this is, of all others, the moſt effectuall retentiue from immode<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate exceſſe &amp; intemperancie, in the vſe of any crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, to conſider the deareneſſe of the price where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with it was bought for vs.</p>
                     <p>Thirdly, being in Chriſt, wee muſt comfort and content our ſelues in all eſtates; for hee is a Store<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>houſe and Treaſurie of all Grace and Peace to all that are his: <hi>Peace I leaue with you; my Peace I giue vnto you, not as the world giueth it; let not your heart be troubled, nor feare, Iohn</hi> 14.</p>
                     <p>Chriſt Ieſus is deſcribed by the Title of his Lord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip; <hi>Our Lord.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Where we are to learne, that Chriſt is a <hi>Ieſus</hi> to none, a diſpencer of Grace and Peace to none, but to thoſe to whom hee is a <hi>Lord.</hi> The world
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:257:48"/> would haue him a IESVS, a <hi>Sauiour,</hi> but in no caſe a <hi>Lord.</hi> They will not beare the burden of his yoke, yet they will needes haue him beare the burden of their ſinnes. But till Chriſt be become our Lord, wee can haue no aſſurance hee is our Sauiour.</p>
                     <p>This I note the rather, becauſe euen at this time, when wee celebrate the memorie of our Sauiours Incarnation, wee moſt of all denie him the right of his Lordſhip, taking libertie to breake out into all outrage of ſinne.</p>

<pb n="87" facs="tcp:257:49"/> place be prayſed: for by this meanes we ſhall both in our ſelues take away ſuſpition of flatterie, and in our brother commended, ſuſpition of pride. And this is the ſpeciall difference betwixt Chriſtian en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couragement and flatterie. The former hath reſpect to Gods glorie, and the good of the partie encoura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged; who hearing God prayſed for his gifts, is taught not to ſwell in a conceit of his owne wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thineſſe, but to referre all to the glorie of God. The latter regardeth neyther; but as it robbeth God of his glorie, and transferreth it to the inſtrument, ſo it driueth the man flattered vpon the Rocks of Pride, Ambition, Vaine-glorie, and there often to make ſhipwracke of a good conſcience.</p>
                     <p>Secondly, The Title that PAVL giueth God in this his Thankſgiuing, <hi>My God.</hi> Here obſerue theſe two points.</p>
                     <p>Firſt, The priuiledge of euery true Chriſtian. <label type="milestone">
                           <seg type="milestoneunit">Doct. </seg>1</label> Hee hath a peculiaritie and ſpeciall proprietie in <note place="margin">The priuiledge of a true Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian.</note> God; That looke as a man may ſay of his Inhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritance, his Houſe and Lands, <hi>Theſe be mine;</hi> ſo hee may as truely ſay of God, <hi>God is mine;</hi> I am righted and intereſſed in him. This priuiledge is conferred vpon vs in the Couenant of Grace, which runnes in this tenor, <hi>I will be thy God, and thou ſhalt be one of my people.</hi> Wee aſſenting to the Condition of this Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenant, to become Gods, God forthwith becomes ours, ſo that we may now lay claime to him as our owne, hee hauing made ouer himſelfe to vs by Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenant. Hence it is, that the Apoſtle ſayth, <hi>Rom.</hi> 5. 11. Wee glorie or boaſt of God, namely, as of our
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:257:50"/> owne, being bound to vs, as the Husband to the Wife, by the Couenant of Marriage. Looke then, as the Husband is not his owne, but the proper poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſion of his Wife; ſo God is now no longer his owne, as it were, but the peculiar poſſeſſion of his Saints.</p>
                     <p>This is a Doctrine of great comfort, That though thou haſt not Houſe, Lands, Mony, Friends, to call thine, yet there is a God in Heauen, whom thou mayeſt call thine; who being thy portion and poſſeſſion, thou mayeſt ioyfully ſing with DAVID, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 16. <hi>The lines are falne to mee in a goodly ground, I haue a faire Heritage.</hi> But this belongeth not to the wicked, becauſe the Couenant is not made with them, by reaſon they agree not to the Condition of becomming Gods people. Therefore <hi>Pſal.</hi> 50. God ſayth to the wicked, <hi>What haſt thou to doe to take my Name in thy mouth?</hi> to brag of me as thy God, <hi>ſince thou hateſt to be reformed?</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Secondly, The nature of true iuſtifying faith, <label type="milestone">
                           <seg type="milestoneunit">Doct. </seg>2</label> which is, to apply God in ſpeciall to the Belee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer. True faith doth not onely beleeue, that God is the God of his Elect in generall, but that hee is his God in ſpeciall, as PAVL here ſayth, <hi>My God.</hi> And Chriſt on the Croſſe, <hi>My Lord, My God.</hi> Chriſt preſently anſwered THOMAS, Becauſe thou haſt ſeene, thou haſt beleeued. Here then is true faith, when with PAVL, <hi>Galat.</hi> 2. 2. we can ſay, Chriſt hath loued me, hath giuen himſelfe for me. This is more then an hypocrite and a temporarie profeſſor can doe.</p>
                     <pb n="89" facs="tcp:257:50"/>
                     <p> The ſecond effect whereby PAVL declareth his loue towards them, is his dayly praying for them, <hi>Making mention of you alwayes in my prayers.</hi> Firſt, in my priuate prayers.</p>
                     <p>Firſt, euen in our priuate, and ſolitarie prayers, <label type="milestone">
                           <seg type="milestoneunit">Doct. </seg>1</label> we muſt be mindfull of our Brethren. Many there <note place="margin">In our Prayers we muſt be mind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full of others.</note> are that in priuate Prayer not at all. Others, though they doe ſometime pray priuately by themſelues, yet then onely they pray for themſelues. And ſo their priuate Prayers are too too priuate, priuate not onely in regard of the place where, but alſo in regard of the Spirit by which they are conceiued, they come from a priuate ſpirit, regarding them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues onely, and not touched with a feeling of the want of others. Saint PAVL writes not to any Church or particular man, but hee tells them, hee made mention of them in his Prayers. And we are to thinke, that hee did no leſſe for many others, that hee neuer wrote to. Had he not the Spirit of loue, it would haue beene tedious vnto him, to haue re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hearſed ſo many names. For we are not to imagine that this mention was onely in generall, vnder the name of Gods Church, for ſo hee prayed for thoſe whoſe faith he neuer heard of. But moſt common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly hee makes this to be the cauſe of thoſe prayers, which, he ſayes, he daily offered for thoſe he writes vnto, <hi>The hearing of their faith and loue,</hi> as here in this place.</p>
                     <p>Let vs therefore, according to this example of Saint PAVL, euen by name remember our Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian friends in our prayers, knowing that the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formance
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:257:51"/> of this dutie is one ſpeciall part of the communion of Saints.</p>
                     <p>Secondly, obſerue, That PAVL did pray euen for thoſe for whom hee gaue thanks: from whence <label type="milestone">
                           <seg type="milestoneunit">Doct. </seg>2</label> it followeth, That there is no man ſo perfect, that hee hath need only to giue thanks for that good hee hath receiued, and not to aske ſome good thing he wanteth.</p>
                     <p>Vnto thankſgiuing therefore for our ſelues or <note place="margin">Thankſgiuing and Petition muſt goe to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether.</note> others, Petition muſt be annexed both for the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuance and increaſe of that good wee giue thanks for. And to ſpeake the truth, thankſgiuing doth neceſſarily carry vs to Petition, for in that wee giue thanks to God for any bleſſing, wee acknowledge him to be the Author thereof, then alſo the Conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuer and Encreaſer, and therefore to haue power to decreaſe, and take it away. When therefore we con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider of thoſe good things, which wee or others haue, and thereby in the ioy of our ſoules are pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uoked to the prayſing of Gods name; we muſt then withall conſider and meditate thus with our ſelues: This or that grace God hath begun in me, and I am wholly beholding to him for it. But vnleſſe his grace follow mee to preſerue that which hee hath begun, I ſhall loſe all, for he it is that worketh both to will and to doe. Thus muſt wee reioyce with trembling, and giue thanks with prayer, tempering the ioy of our thankſgiuing, with the Chriſtian feare of Prayer. And moſt true it is, that he which feeleth moſt ioy in the fruition of any bleſſing, is moſt fearfull of loſing it. And therefore in his feare
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:257:51"/> of loſing it, vnto that thankſgiuing which his ioy cauſed, hee will adioyne earneſt Prayer for the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuance of it. Wee muſt not then be like the Pha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſe in the Goſpell, who onely giueth thanks, but thinking himſelfe full and perfect, and complete, asketh nothing. But as the feeling of Gods good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe muſt ſtirre vs to thankſgiuing; ſo the feeling of our wants and weakneſſes, mixed alwayes with thoſe things wherein Gods goodneſſe ſheweth it ſelfe, muſt driue vs to prayer.</p>
                     <p>Thirdly, wee may obſerue, that PHILEMON <label type="milestone">
                           <seg type="milestoneunit">Doct. </seg>3</label> was ſuch an one as miniſtred to PAVL iuſt occaſion, as of Prayer, ſo likewiſe of Thankſgiuing. Wee muſt labour herein to be like him, that others, ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially Gods Miniſters, who eyther ſee vs, or heare of vs, may haue cauſe not onely to pray for vs, but alſo to prayſe God for vs.</p>
                     <p>Many there are that we haue cauſe to pray for, and that with great griefe that they are ſo bad. But there is ſmall matter for thankſgiuing in them. But we ſhould be ſuch, that our friends may pray for vs, not with griefe, but ioy, and giuing of thankes vnto God for vs.</p>

                        <seg rend="decorInit">B</seg>Oth the effects of PAVLS loue to PHILEMON, Thankeſgiuing and Prayer, are here both ſet forth by the cauſe moouing him both to giue thankes, and pray for them: for ſo I vnderſtand, that in them the Apoſtle ſetteth downe as well the cauſe of his Prayer, as of his Thankeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giuing, the which is more euident, by comparing this place with <hi>Coloſſ.</hi> 1. 3, 4. where the ſame wordes almoſt are vſed that are here, that Epiſtle (as ſome not vnprobably thinke) written at the ſame time, as it was ſent by the ſame Meſſengers that this was.</p>
                     <p>Firſt then obſerue, That the greater graces wee <label type="milestone">
                           <seg type="milestoneunit">Doct. </seg>1</label> heare any of our Brethren to haue, the more feruent <note place="margin">Pray for thoſe moſt, whoſe gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces are greateſt.</note> Prayers ought wee to powre out for them vnto the Lord, as appeareth in that place, <hi>Coloſſ.</hi> 1. 3, 4. <hi>Wee giue thankes to God, praying alwayes for you, ſince, or after that we once heard of your faith.</hi> The more grace there is in any, the greater muſt our loue be.

Againe, the greater grace there is, the greater will be Satans ſpight and malice, labouring euen out of that grace, to worke diſgrace to GOD and his Goſpell. And therefore the greater cauſe
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:257:52"/> haue we to double the feruencie of our Prayers for the reſiſting of Satan.</p>
                     <p>Secondly, Marke what it is either in others, or <label type="milestone">
                           <seg type="milestoneunit">Doct. </seg>2</label> in our ſelues, that eſpecially ſhould cauſe vs to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ioyce <note place="margin">The cauſe of Ioy and Thankſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giuing.</note> and giue thankes, namely, ſauing, and ſan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctifying Grace, Faith, Loue, &amp;c. Many reioyce to ſee their Children prooue wiſe, wittie, wealthie, when yet they bee poore enough in Faith and loue. But yet there is no matter of ioy in common gifts ſeuered from ſanctification, nay, there is matter of great griefe, for they are not matters of ornament, but of deformity rather. Wit, Wiſdome, Eloquence, &amp;c. doe nothing become a wicked man, nay, they diſgrace him rather; for that which SALOMON ſpea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth of beautie in a wicked woman, may truely be ſaid of all other common gifts, in all, both men and women that are vngodly: <hi>They are in them, as the golden Ring in the ſnowt of a Swine.</hi> If then wee would haue true matter of reioycing and thankeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giuing, let vs not reſt contented with common gifts of Nature, but let vs put vpon the Earings of Nature the Iewell of Grace: then may we haue ioy of our ſelues, and cauſe to bleſſe the Name of the Lord. Not but that wee ſhould giue thankes for other common graces, but yet firſt as fruit of theſe, and ſecondly, ſpecially, and principally for theſe, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counting one dramme of Faith, one graine of Grace, farre aboue many pounds of naturall parts, thinking our ſelues more beholding to GOD, for that ſmall meaſure of ſanctification which we haue, then for all the ornaments of Nature whatſoeuer.</p>
                     <pb n="94" facs="tcp:257:53"/>
                     <p> Therefore ſpirituall bleſſings in Chriſt ſhould ſo affect vs, and ſo poſſeſſe and take vp our minds and meditations, that wee may ſeeme in a holy kind of forgetfulneſſe to paſſe by the pettie inferiour bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſings of this life, as hauing no leyſure almoſt to thinke of them.</p>
                     <p>Thirdly, In that PAVL maketh PHILEMONS faith <label type="milestone">
                           <seg type="milestoneunit">Doct. </seg>3</label> and loue the matter of his Thankſgiuing, and reioy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing with him, wee learne, that much more is faith and loue a iuſt cauſe of reioycing to the owner of them. Why then ſhould the child of God at any time ſo hang downe the head, and be deiected in mind, but that in the middeſt of his griefe he ſhould reioyce, finding in himſelfe any meaſure of true faith? Therefore the Apoſtle willeth vs alwayes to reioyce in the Lord, as being neuer deſtitute of that faith, which layeth hold vpon that our Lord Ieſus Chriſt. Muſt the faith of our brethren miniſter mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of ioy and thankſgiuing, and ſhall not our owne faith much more doe the like?</p>
                     <p>Fourthly, Marke the occaſion of PAVLS thankſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giuing <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/> for theſe graces of God in PHILEMON: we cannot reioyce and giue thankes for thoſe bleſſings we know not: PAVL therefore muſt needes haue knowledge of PHILEMONS faith and loue; but how came he to that? By the report and relation of faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full witneſſes. <hi>Hearing of thy faith and loue:</hi> Here many things are to be noted.</p>
                     <p>Firſt, See in PAVLS example, what is the effect that <label type="milestone">
                           <seg type="milestoneunit">Doct. </seg>1</label> the good report which the godly heare of their bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren, vſeth to worke in their minds. Commonly
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:257:53"/> men ſucke in their owne prayſes with very greedie and thirſtie eares, but they cannot with patience en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dure the prayſes of others, thinking, that the prayſes of others, is a cloſe kind of diſprayſing themſelues, and that ſo much is taken from them, as is giuen vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to another. Hence it is, that the ſpeech of thoſe that are much in the commendations of others, is ſo te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dious &amp; troubleſome to vs, in that thereby we feele our ſelues ſtirred vp to wrath, fretting, enuy, and ſuch like diſtemper of corrupt affections. But it is farre <note place="margin">The godly heare the good report of their brethren with ioy.</note> otherwiſe with the children of God, who haue the circumciſed eares of PAVL, that not only with pati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, but with great ioy, can heare the commendati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of their brethren, and vpon the hearing of them, breake forth, not into fretting and fuming, but into a holy lauding of the Name of the Lord. As thoſe Iewes did, <hi>Gal.</hi> 1. 22, 23. Away then with that vncir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumciſed Eare of Enuy, that is offended with ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther mans prayſe, as an vnpleaſing and diſtaſtfull ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iect. Chriſt called Enuy by the name of <hi>an euill Eye;</hi> Surely, we may as well giue it the name of <hi>an euill Eare,</hi> which is no leſſe vnwilling to heare, then the Eye to ſee, the good of our brother.</p>
                     <p>Secondly, Obſerue, that thankes are due to God, <label type="milestone">
                           <seg type="milestoneunit">Doct. </seg>2</label> not onely for thoſe benefits which he beſtoweth on <note place="margin">Thanks muſt be giuen for others.</note> vs our ſelues, but on our brethren alſo. And therfore if we pay him not this debt, he may iuſtly charge vs with ingratitude: for ſhall we confeſſe it our duty, to pray for our brethren, that they may be enriched with theſe graces; and ſhall we not thinke our ſelues equally bound to giue thanks to God, when he hath heard our prayers?</p>
                     <pb n="96" facs="tcp:257:54"/>
                     <p> This is a rule: Whatſoeuer we pray for, the ſame when it ſhall be granted, are we to giue thankes for, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 50. 15. Againe, in the diuers diſpenſation of graces, Gods glorie, which wee are bound to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deeme, euen with our owne liues, is exceedingly ſet forth. And how can I, the ſonne of God, behold the glory of my heauenly Father, and not haue my heart reſoluing and melting it ſelfe with ioy? More<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouer, we are to know, that the bleſſing of our Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren, by vertue of that neere coniunction wee are knit together in, are ours, wee haue a ſpeciall right and intereſt in them. This is that Communion, in the which thoſe words, <hi>mine</hi> and <hi>thine,</hi> muſt not bee heard. <hi>My</hi> gifts are <hi>thine,</hi> and <hi>thine</hi> are <hi>mine,</hi> in regard of the profit and emolument of them. The eye in the naturall bodie ſeeth not for it ſelfe, but for the whole bodie. Hence PAVL, 1. <hi>Cor.</hi> 3. ſaith to the <hi>Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rinthians, All things are yours,</hi> euen the moſt excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent gifts of the Apoſtles. They might lay claime to them, as being by God appointed for their benefit. When then we behold a more plentifull bleſſing in another then in our ſelues, let vs then thinke with our ſelues, how we haue our part therein, how God therein hath prouided for our good. And therefore in enuying thy Brother Gods bountie and liberali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie, thou doeſt withall vnnaturally enuie thy ſelfe, thine owne good that is incloſed in thoſe gifts of thy Brother. So much PAVL by his practice here ſheweth. This is the moſt ſpeciall ground of dri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing away enuie, and ſtirring vp ioy in vs, in the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holding of any good thing in our Brother, namely,
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:257:54"/> to conſider, that we haue our part therein. Is there any man ſo fooliſh, to enuie his neighbour a more plentifull Crop of Corne, then he himſelfe hath in his owne Field, if ſo be that he ſhall haue a ſhare in his neighbours Crop? Nay, rather he would be glad, becauſe the more his neighbour hath, the grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter will his profit be. And ſurely, it is very ſtrange: Who is it, that would take it heauily, that a piece of Money ſhould be put into another mans hands, ſo he ſhall haue as much gaine by it, as he in whoſe hands it is? Will he not rather be glad, that he is rid of ſo great a trouble, and freed from ſo great a feare, which the charge of the Mony would haue brought vpon him; for he ſhall haue an equall diuident in the gaine with him, in whoſe cuſtodie it is; in the meane time being free from the negotiating, and of feare leſt the Mony miſcarrying, hee be made to make it good? The caſe is the ſame here. The en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſe that comes of the gifts of thy brother, is as well thine as his. If the principall ſuſtaine any dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger, he muſt look to that; thou art not to be account<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able for his negligence and vnskilfulneſſe. I, but thou wilt ſay, Herein is my brother aduanced aboue me, in that he is ſo be truſted with ſo many Talents; God doth not me the like honor. O foole! doth this grieue thee? Thou lookeſt vpon the honor, but ſeeſt not the burden annexed; for to whom much is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted, of him ſhall much be exacted: and when he is called to his account, if he be found either idle, or vnfaithfull, the greater wil his iudgement be. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore think with thy ſelfe thus: If the Lord had made
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:257:55"/> me ſteward of thoſe gifts, haply I might haue fayled in the skilfull and faithfull imployment of them. So in the end there ſhould haue beene a heauie recko<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning for me. Gods dealing is both therefore wiſe and mercifull towards me. If theſe Talents had beene in my hands, they might haue periſhed with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any aduantage to God, my ſelfe, or the Church. Now then, how wiſe is God, to put them into the hands of a more skilfull husband, that can employ and vſe them better then I ſhould, and yeeld a grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter encreaſe of profit, euen to my owne ſelfe, then I my ſelfe could haue done, if I my ſelfe haue had the husbanding of them in my owne hands? For it is moſt certaine, that many men would not haue halfe that benefit of the gifts of God, being in their owne keeping, which they haue now, being conferred vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on others. As the foot, if it ſhould haue the power of ſeeing, which is in the eye, it could make nothing that vſe of it, which it doth now, whileſt it is in the eye. Here then is a further cauſe of Thankſgiuing, for the bleſſings of God vpon our brethren, not only that we haue benefit by them, but more benefit of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentimes, then if we had them our ſelues in our owne poſſeſſion. Wherefore that common prouerbe is to be left, which we vſe when we ſee any good bleſſing hath befalne our brother. O, ſuch a one may thanke God. It is true: But why doeſt thou lay that dutie wholly vpon him, &amp; exempt thy ſelfe? Mayeſt thou not thanke God too, to whom the Lord is benefici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all in thy brother? The oyntment powred on AA<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>RONS head, though firſt of all, &amp; in greater quantity,
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:257:55"/> it lighted vpon the next parts, the beard, the ſhoul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders, &amp;c. yet from them it deſcended to the nether<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt Veſtments. So the graces of our Head Chriſt, though firſt they come to thoſe that are the moſt e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minent members in his body, yet they reſt not in them, but from them they drop and diſtill downe vpon the inferior members, and that in farre greater meaſure, then if they had flowne immediatly from the Head to them. Wherefore, as in Confeſſion we are bound to lament and bewaile the ſinnes of our brethren, as our owne; ſo likewiſe in Thankſgiuing to reioyce in their bleſſings, euen as if they were our owne.</p>
                     <p>Thirdly, If in PAVLS example, others are bound to giue thanks for our graces; then it is our part, who <label type="milestone">
                           <seg type="milestoneunit">Doct. </seg>3</label> through Gods mercies are poſſeſſed of any of his graces, ſo to vſe them, that we may miniſter iuſt cauſe to our brethren to giue thanks for them. For many there are, very richly endowed with varietie of graces, that yet abuſing and peruerting them to the hurt of the Church, or not vſing them at all, but lapping them vp in a Napkin, and burying them in the bowels of the Earth, giue occaſion rather of griefe, then of thankſgiuing. But they ſhould re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member, that they are no Lords, or Proprietaries of their Gifts, that they may ſay with him in the Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pell, <hi>Are they not our owne, may we not do with our owne what we liſt?</hi> No; they muſt know, as DANIEL very ingenuouſly confeſſed, concerning the Gift of Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phecie, before NEBVCHADNEZAR, <hi>Dan.</hi> 2. 32. that they haue receiued them for the Church, whoſe ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uants
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:257:56"/> and debtors they are. And therefore, if wee ſhall not communicate our gifts to the Church and people of God, they will complaine of vs to God, and complaine of vs of iniuſtice, in with-holding the good from the owners thereof, contrarie to SA<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>LOMONS Precept, <hi>Prou.</hi> 3. 27.</p>
                     <p>Fourthly, PAVL ſaying, that he heard of the Faith <label type="milestone">
                           <seg type="milestoneunit">Doct. </seg>4</label> and Loue of PHILEMON, plainly ſheweth, that there were ſome that related &amp; reported them to him. By whoſe example we muſt learne, to haue a ſpeciall re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect of the good name of our brother, being alwaies ready, as occaſion ſhal ſerue, to ſpeake of thoſe good things that are in others; that ſo their names, as it were, being ſented &amp; perfumed with this oyntment, may haue a moſt ſweet &amp; fragrant odor in all places. But where is the man that will thus labor to vphold the credit of his brother? that will acknowledge Gods graces in him in all places, and at all times, and will not rather with ſome one infirmitie ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>whelme whatſoeuer is prayſe-worthie in him?</p>
                     <p>Fifthly, Obſerue Gods prouidence, recompencing <label type="milestone">
                           <seg type="milestoneunit">Doct. </seg>5</label> Faith with fame and good name: when Faith ſhall <note place="margin">A good report the recompence of Religion.</note> open our hearts and mouthes to extoll Gods name, God will open our brethrens, yea, ſometimes our enemies mouthes, to extoll ours, <hi>Heb.</hi> 11. 3. <hi>By this</hi> (namely Faith) <hi>our Elders obtained a good report.</hi> This was the meanes whereby they became ſo famous. What maruell then, if thou haſt an ill name, when thou haſt an ill conſcience? Naughty faith and fame, crackt credit and conſcience, commonly goe toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. The vſe of oyntments among the Ancients was
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:257:56"/> eſpecially in their Feaſts. Then may wee looke for God to come &amp; drench vs with the precious Oynt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of a good Name, when wee are keeping the Feaſt of a good Conſcience. If we would ſerue God with a good Conſcience, by faith purged from dead Workes, then ſhould wee find, that God, who ſeeth our Faith and good Conſcience in ſecret, would re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward vs with credit and eſtimation openly.</p>
                     <p>Thus much generally concerning the cauſe and matter of PAVLS praying vnto, and prayſing God, <hi>viz.</hi> the hearing of Gods graces in PHILEMON.</p>
                     <p>Now more particularly, let vs conſider what theſe Graces are. There are two ſet downe here by name; firſt, <hi>the Loue;</hi> ſecondly, <hi>the Faith of</hi> PHILEMON: Both theſe Graces are ſet forth by their Obiects, whereabout they are conuerſant, <hi>Which thou haſt to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards our Lord Ieſus, and all Saints.</hi> Both theſe Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iects belong in common to Loue, the former onely to Faith. By Faith onely we apprehend Chriſt, and vnite our ſelues to him; but by Loue, we apprehend and vnite our ſelues both to Chriſt and our fellow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>members. Thus then is the meaning of the words, and thus they are to be conſtrued, <hi>Hearing of thy Faith and Loue;</hi> thy Faith, which thou haſt in our Lord Ieſus; and thy Loue, which thou haſt both to our Lord Ieſus, and all Saints. The Rhemiſts there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore erre by this place, confirming that confidence which they teach vs to repoſe in the merites of the Saints, whereas it is manifeſt by the ſeuenth Verſe, that the Apoſtle ſpeaketh not of the dead, but of li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing Saints.</p>
                     <pb n="102" facs="tcp:257:57"/>
                     <p> Here then two points ſpecially are to be conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered.</p>
                     <list>
                        <item>
                           <hi>Firſt,</hi> theſe two vertues, <hi>Loue</hi> and <hi>Faith.</hi>
                        </item>
                        <item>
                           <hi>Secondly,</hi> their <hi>obiects: towards the Lord Ieſus and all Saints.</hi>
                        </item>
                     </list>
                     <p>Firſt, for the Vertues: the firſt place is here giuen to <hi>Loue,</hi> though both in nature and excellency it comes behind Faith, as the Effect the Cauſe, the Daughter the Mother, <hi>Gal.</hi> 5. 1. <hi>Tim.</hi> 1. 6. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore elſe-where Faith is ſet before, as <hi>Coloſſ.</hi> 1. 6. 1. <hi>Theſſal.</hi> 1. 3. But nothing is more vſuall in the Scriptures, then to giue the former place vnto the effect, as being more obuious to our ſenſes then the cauſe.</p>
                     <p>By Faith vnderſtand iuſtifying Faith, which on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly is able to bring forth true Loue, either to God or man: and by Loue, as the Apoſtle ſheweth, not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly loue to God, but alſo to man. Here obſerue</p>
                     <p>Firſt, the diſtinction of theſe graces of Faith and <label type="milestone">
                           <seg type="milestoneunit">Doct. </seg>1</label> Loue. They are named diſtinctly as two Vertues, 1. <hi>Cor.</hi> 13. in the end. <hi>There remayne theſe three, Faith, Hope, and Charitie.</hi> This obſeruation will not ſeeme idle, if we conſider the Doctrine of the Papiſts con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning faith, <hi>viz.</hi> that there is a two fold Faith, one informed, and a ſecond formed, and that by Chari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie. They make Charitie the forme, the life and ſoule of Faith, which if it were ſo, then Faith and Loue are not to be diſtinguiſhed, but confounded. Neither could the Apoſtle ſay, Theſe three, but, Theſe two remain. Neither could Charitie be preferred before Faith, in reſpect of long durance; for the forme of
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:257:57"/> a thing is the thing it ſelfe, and therefore as long as the forme laſts, ſo long the thing it ſelfe conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nueth.</p>
                     <p>Secondly, the coniunction of theſe two Graces, <label type="milestone">
                           <seg type="milestoneunit">Doct. </seg>2</label> for howſoeuer they are to be diſtinguiſhed, yet not <note place="margin">Faith and Loue are diſtinguiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, not diuided.</note> to be diuided. Whereſoeuer true Faith is, there ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſarily Loue, both to God and our Brethren, will follow: for though Faith be alone in <hi>iuſtification,</hi> yet not in the <hi>iuſtified:</hi> As the eye, though alone in ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, yet not in him that ſeeth, but ioyned with the eares, noſe, and many other members of the body. Faith therefore is a fruitfull Mother of many daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, and Loue is the firſt-borne of them: Faith, though it be in regard of God, a Begger, alwayes holding out the hand to receiue, and crying, <hi>Giue, giue,</hi> yet in regard of thoſe in whom it dwelleth, it is like a Soueraigne Lord and King, and hath as a King his Officers vnder him, and among the reſt, Loue, his Almner, to diſtribute and diſperſe thoſe treaſures, which it ſelfe hath receiued from the Lord. And firſt of all, our loue towards God pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedeth <note place="margin">Our loue to God proceeds from Faith.</note> from Faith, which apprehending Gods loue to vs, enflameth our affections againe with the loue of God. The bearnes of Gods loue lightning vpon our hearts, reflect backe vpon God himſelfe, by the Vertue of our Faith. <hi>The loue of Christ,</hi> ſaith the Apoſtle, namely, being apprehended by our Faith, <hi>conſtrayneth vs.</hi> An example whereof we haue in MARY MAGDALEN, whoſe Faith beleeuing, that much was forgiuen her, cauſed and conſtrayned her to loue much, <hi>Luk.</hi> 7.</p>
                     <p n="1">
                        <pb n="104" facs="tcp:257:58"/> 1. This plainly conuinceth the Faith of many to be <label type="milestone">
                           <seg type="milestoneunit">Ʋſe. </seg>
                        </label> nothing but vaine preſumption, becauſe their loue to God is ſo luke-warme. Thou mockeſt thy owne ſoule, O thou vaine man, whoſe diſobedience, though it teſtifie to thy face that thou hateſt GOD, wilt yet be bragging of the ſtrength and aſſurance of thy Faith: wee ſee, when men haue without our deſert beene extraordinarily kind vnto vs, how wee are affected therewith, neuer ſatisfying our affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons toward them. Is it likely then that thou art per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaded of that infinite loue of God in Chriſt, and haſt the eye of Faith to ſee the height, the depth, the bredth, and length thereof; how, thou being a ſlaue of Satan, fettered with the chaines of darkneſſe in Hell, waſt reſcued and looſed by the death of his owne Son, when yet thou ceaſeſt not moſt ſhame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully to diſhonour this God, by a wicked and vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>godly conuerſation? So if thou haddeſt once felt the loue of God ſhed abroad into thy heart, and did<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſt beleeue that God had done ſo much for thee, as thou ſayeſt, Oh, then how zealouſly wouldeſt thou loue the Lord, declaring the truth of that ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent ſaying of PAVL, <hi>Faith works by Loue!</hi> Yea, but I loue God, or elſe it were pitie I ſhould liue. Thou lyeſt, heare Chriſt. <hi>If you loue mee, keepe my Commandements.</hi> And yet thou delighteſt thy ſoule in the daily breach of them, for all this ſo affectio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate entreatie of him, whom thou profeſſeſt thy Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiour. Behold MARY MAGDALEN, and in her, ſee vndoubted arguments of loue. Her eyes which had beene entiſements to vncleanneſſe, ſhe maketh
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:257:58"/> a Baſon of water to waſh CHRISTS feete, her haire abuſed to the ſame purpoſe, a towell to wipe them.</p>
                     <p>Thou then that preferreſt thy vnlawfull pleaſures before Chriſt, whatſoeuer thou confeſſeſt with thy mouth, certainly, thou beleeueſt not with thy heart vnto ſaluation.</p>
                     <p>Secondly, but as this Doctrine is terrible to the Hypocrite, whom it vnmasketh of his vaine viz<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zard of faith, ſo it is no leſſe comfortable to the true Chriſtian: For what doeſt thou feele thy ſoule panting and breathing in the earneſtneſſe of deſire after God? doeſt thou find thy ſelfe grieued when thou miſſeſt of thy deſire? doeſt thou finde thy heart to ariſe, when thou ſeeſt Gods Name diſho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noured, &amp;c? Surely, theſe things as they are ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guments of ſincere loue, ſo likewiſe of Faith not fayned.</p>
                     <p>If thou feeleſt theſe things in any manner, in thy ſelfe, thou mayeſt truly ſay with him in the Goſpell, <hi>Lord, I beleeue.</hi> For it is impoſſible for vs to loue God, vnleſſe by Faith wee haue taſted how ſweet Gods loue is to vs. But if thou findeſt theſe things in a ſmaller meaſure then is fit, goe on with the ſame man, and ſay, <hi>Helpe my vnbeliefe.</hi> For as true Loue argueth true Faith; ſo a luke warme loue, a faint and feeble faith. For the Fountayne of Loue being as a good Conſcience, ſo likewiſe, and that primarily and originally, Faith not fay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, 1. <hi>Tim.</hi> 1. <hi>verſ.</hi> 6. Looke what meaſure of Loue there is in any, the like meaſure of Faith alſo.
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:257:59"/> If then we find great want of zeale in our ſelues, we haue cauſe to bewaile the ſmalneſſe of our Faith, out yet ſo that feeling any meaſure of zeale at all, we may raiſe vp our ſelues in a comfortable aſſurance of hauing Faith. Therefore, 1. <hi>Pet.</hi> 1. after that hee had ſaid, They loued the Lord, he inferreth preſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, that they alſo beleeued in him. In temptations oftentimes many excellent men are greatly trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled with doubting, whether they haue Faith or no, in as much as they cannot confidently and boldly, nay, ſcarſe faintly and fearefully ſay that Chriſt is theirs, but rather they are readie to ſay the contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry. They feele the hand of Faith not onely trem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bling and quiuering, but euen ſtrucken with a dead Palſie. But if at the ſame time thou canſt perceiue that thou haſt the giuing hand of Loue, giuing vnto God and man thoſe duties which thou oweſt them thou mayeſt aſſure thy ſelfe that thou haſt alſo the receiuing hand of Faith, taking thoſe mercies which hee owes thee not, howſoeuer for the preſent thou haſt no feeling of it, Satan and Sinne haue ſo be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nummed it. If thou canſt with DAVID, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 18. 1. ſay, <hi>I loue the Lord,</hi> thou mayeſt as truely vſe the words following, and ſay, <hi>The Lord is my Rocke.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Thirdly, this Doctrine of Loues iſſuing and flowing from Faith, confuteth thoſe that teach, our Election dependeth vpon our foreſeene obedience. By that which hath beene deliuered, it appeareth that our loue of God is cauſed and ſtirred vp in vs by his loue, to vs apprehended by our Faith. And therefore we ſay with IOHN, <hi>We loue him, becauſe he</hi>
                        <pb n="107" facs="tcp:257:59"/> 
                        <hi>loued vs first.</hi> But according to their Doctrine con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trariwiſe, God loues vs, becauſe we loued him firſt.</p>
                     <p>Fourthly, this Doctrine teacheth vs what to iudge of that loue of God, of that deuotion that is in Ethnicks, Iewes, Papiſts, or any ſuperſtitious perſons. PAVL granteth to the Iewes a zealous loue of God, but ſaith, that it is not according to know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, which is the very beginning of Faith. But we haue ſhewed that the true loue of God, is the hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maid of Faith. And therefore if it ſhall wait vpon any other Miſtris, as vpon blind deuices of mans owne braine, vpon good intentions falſly ſo called, it is to be cenſured as a baſe, a blind, and prepoſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous zeale, whatſoeuer ſhewes and colours it may haue. For PAVL reioyceth in PHILEMON, not for his loue alone, but for his loue and faith, that is, for his loue conioyned with, and proceeding from his Faith. There is no matter of ioy then, in Loue ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uered from Faith.</p>
                     <p>Thus wee ſee how our loue of God comes from Faith.</p>
                     <p>Secondly, our loue of our Brethren ſpringeth <note place="margin">Loue to our Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren proceeds from Faith.</note> likewiſe from faith, for the Apoſtle ſpeaketh here of both loues.</p>
                     <p>This will appeare, if either we conſider thoſe du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties of loue, which wee owe generally to all, or in ſpeciall to ſome.</p>
                     <p>For the firſt, this is a dutie which wee owe to all indifferently, to be readie to forgiue one another, being offended. Now what is that which will make a reuengefull nature yeeld to this, but Faith, which
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:257:60"/> when once it hath apprehended Gods loue, forth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with reaſoneth, as the Maſter in the Parable with his ſeruant, <hi>Matth.</hi> 19. The Lord hath freely forgi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen mee my whole debt, ought not I then to ſhew the like compaſſion to my fellow-ſeruant? There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Lord enioyning the dutie of forgiueneſſe; the Apoſtles pray, Lord, increaſe our Faith, <hi>Luk.</hi> 17. 4, 5. <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 5. <hi>Forgiuing one another, euen as God for Chriſts ſake, hath forgiuen you:</hi> and, 1. <hi>Ioh.</hi> 2. 12. <hi>I write vnto you</hi> (namely, the Commandement of loue) <hi>becauſe your ſinnes are forgiuen you.</hi> Other du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties there are which we owe ſpecially to ſome: As firſt, to thoſe that are yet vnconuerted, the deſiring of, and by all meanes poſſible labouring after their conuerſion. Now, it is Faith only which will make a man doe this: For, when by Faith wee haue felt the ſweetneſſe of Gods loue our ſelues, we cannot but call vpon others, and with the Prophet DAVID inuite them to the eating of the ſame dainties with our ſelues. <hi>Pſ.</hi> 34. <hi>Come, and ſee, and taſte how good, &amp;c.</hi> As at the table, if wee meet with any diſh that plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth vs aboue another, wee offer it preſently to o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, deſiring that it may haue their commendati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on as well as ours. Thus EVE reached forth the Apple to ADAM. Albeit here there be many (to whom yet EVE, though falne, was vnlike) ſo giuen to their appetites, and louing their bellies, that if they light vpon any meate which they loue more ſpecially, they, like rauenous Harpies ſnatch it all to themſelues, grudging another the leaſt morſell, thinking all is loſt that goes beſides their owne lips.
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:257:60"/> But here no ſuch thing can fall out; for theſe exqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſite delicates do ſo fully ſatiate vs, that there ſtill re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maineth ynough for many thouſand thouſands. Therefore we cannot endure to eat our Morſels a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone, but we deſire the companie of others, as PAVL did AGRIPPAES, and the whole Aſſembly there preſent beſides, <hi>Acts</hi> 26. <hi>Would to God, that both thou and all that heare me this day, were not onely almoſt, but altogether, euen ſuch as I am</hi> (Chriſtians) <hi>except theſe bonds.</hi> But yet a more ſpeciall loue, which there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore hath a ſpeciall name of brotherly loue, is due vnto thoſe which are alreadie effectually called, and ſo made members of Chriſt.</p>
                     <p>This loue alſo commeth from faith, which cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing vs to loue God, muſt needes alſo force vs to loue all thoſe, in whom wee ſhall ſee the very face and liuely Image of God himſelfe ſo clearely ſhi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning.</p>
                     <p>Firſt, By this then once againe wee may trie our <label type="milestone">
                           <seg type="milestoneunit">Vſe. </seg>
                        </label> faith. A working faith hath laborious loue euen to our brethren annexed, 1. <hi>Theſſ.</hi> 1. 3. If then thou art of a hard and implacable nature, of a memorie faſtly retayning iniuries of affections vindicatiue, which the Scripture cals, Feet ſwift to ſhead bloud, this bloudie nature of thine ſhewes thou haſt no part in the bloud of Chriſt by faith. The like is to be thought of thoſe which are moued with no com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſion towards the ſoule of their brethren, ſitting in darkneſſe and the ſhadow of death, but can ſuffer them to pine and periſh away in their ſinnes, and ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer reach forth the hand, to pull them out of the
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:257:61"/> ditch. Certainly, if thou hadſt euer felt the gaine of godlineſſe thy ſelfe, thou wouldeſt perſwade others to deale with this ſo gainfull a commoditie. They that are conuerted of God, confirme their Brethren; being paſſed ouer the bridge, they will wiſh others to follow them; ſo farre will they be from plucking vp the bridge. The ſame ſentence alſo is to be paſſed vpon them, that doe not feele their hearts enlarged towards Chriſtians more then to others, that are none. If the Image of God by Faith were repaired in our ſelues, wee could not but be delighted with thoſe that are like our ſelues. But on the contrarie, if thou feeleſt theſe effects of loue in thy ſelfe, vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doubtedly, thou haſt Faith. For it is the loue of Chriſt only felt by Faith, which is able to ſoften and melt our hard and frozen hearts. When wee ſhall ſee how great a debt hee hath forgiuen vs, this will make vs willingly to forgiue ſmall ones to our Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren, yea, and to bury all iniuries in the graue of forgetfulneſſe, neuer to reuiue againe, euen as Chriſt hath done all ours to him, though neuer ſo indigne and contumelious: hee lodged them in his owne graue, not to riſe againe with himſelfe the third day, (though many of vs raiſe vp our owne iniuries farre ſooner out of their graues) but to be left behind him in that Den of darkneſſe, to ſleepe an eternall ſleepe. So, when Faith ſhall cauſe vs to conſider, how that the Lord Ieſus, being rich, became poore, that wee might be made rich, this will make vs to earne in the bowells of compaſſion towards our poore and diſtreſſed Brethren, and to reach forth
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:257:61"/> our releeuing hand towards them. But the moſt e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uident demonſtration of our Faith, is that brother<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly loue, wherewithall we loue a Chriſtian as a Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian, and becauſe a Chriſtian. 1. <hi>Ioh.</hi> 3. <hi>Wee know that we are tranſlated from death to life, becauſe we loue the Brethren:</hi> for none can loue any good thing vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowne. Loue preſuppoſes knowledge of the thing loued: hee then that loues the Image of God in his Brother, ſees it. But none can ſee it, but by the eye of Faith. He that loueth his Brother for his Faith, muſt needs know Faith: but no man can know it, but hee that hath it; Faith is onely knowne by our owne experience.</p>
                     <p>Secondly, this Doctrine ſerueth not only for the tryall of our Faith, but alſo of our loue to our Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren: for as that Faith, which is without this Loue, is an idle and emptie, and imaginarie faith, ſo that loue of our Neighbour, which commeth not from Faith, is blind and fooliſh, and in the end will proue a deceitfull, and vnfaithfull loue. Naturall men, that ſeeme to loue very dearly to day, to morrow are at deadly feud.</p>
                     <p>The reaſon hereof is, becauſe their loue comes not from Faith. Therefore amongſt the true chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren of God, yee ſhall neuer ſee ſuch bitter fallings out, as amongſt worldly men. In naturall men and the vnregenerate, beſides naturall affections, which they haue as Fathers, Huſbands, Wiues, Children, yee ſhall find further many times a kind and cour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous nature to ſtrangers, a liberall and free heart to the poore. But that which the Apoſtle ſpeaketh of
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:257:62"/> Faith, void of Charitie, 1. <hi>Cor.</hi> 13. is true alſo of Charitie, void of Faith. It is worth nothing before God. Let vs not then deceiue our ſelues, either tru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſting in the loue of others, or glorying in that loue which is in our ſelues, not proceeding from Faith: for the former, if wee rely too much vpon it, it will giue vs a ſhrewd fall in the end, and the latter will make vs but aſhamed, when it ſhal come to be ſcan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned before Gods Tribunall, who will eſteeme moſt vilely and baſely of all thy kind-heartedneſſe, of all thy almes and liberalitie, vnleſſe Faith did wring them from thee.</p>
                     <p>Thus wee ſee how Faith, when once it raigneth in the heart, begetteth both theſe loues, both to God and our Neighbour, in vs, and ſo how true that of the Apoſtle is, <hi>Rom.</hi> 3. in the end, <hi>By Faith we eſtabliſh the Law.</hi> For whereas the ſumme of the Law is loue, of the firſt Table to God, of the ſecond to man; Faith, as we haue ſhewed, very effectually worketh both. Hence PAVL giueth the name of a Law to Faith, calling it the <hi>Law of Faith,</hi> becauſe it ſucceedeth into the roome of the Law, comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding the ſame things that the Law does, and ſo is in ſtead of Law to the regenerate that are freed from the Law. So farre is it (as the Papiſts ſlander vs) for giuing any licence to breake the Law.</p>
                     <p>Thirdly, here it may be asked, How could o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers <label type="milestone">
                           <seg type="milestoneunit">Queſt. </seg>
                        </label> declare to PAVL the <hi>Loue</hi> and <hi>Faith</hi> of PHI<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>LEMON, which are ſecret and hidden Vertues, that be in the innermoſt corners of the heart, farre from the ſight of the eye?</p>
                     <pb n="113" facs="tcp:257:62"/>
                     <p> They ſaw not PHILEMONS faith, but his out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward <label type="milestone">
                           <seg type="milestoneunit">Anſw. </seg>
                        </label> works, and by them they iudged, and ſo did PAVL too of his faith, diſcerning the Tree by the fruit. Hence obſerue.</p>
                     <p>Firſt, when we ſee in any the fruits of Faith and <label type="milestone">
                           <seg type="milestoneunit">Doct. </seg>1</label> Loue, wee in Charitie are to iudge that there is true Faith and Loue indeed: for howſoeuer Hypocriſie may Apiſhly counterfait the fruits of true Faith, yet we are to ſuſpend our iudgement till God ſhall haue vncaſed the Hypocrite. And it is farre ſafer for vs to erre of Charitie, then of malice and ſiniſter ſuſpition.</p>
                     <p>Secondly, in that PAVL, by a Metonymie of the <label type="milestone">
                           <seg type="milestoneunit">Doct. </seg>2</label> efficient, giueth the name of Faith and Loue, to the outward works of PHILEMON, which were re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported vnto him: Wee learne the manner wherein euery good worke muſt be done, namely, in Faith and Loue.</p>
                     <p>The very Spirits and quinteſſence of our Faith and Loue, muſt be in euery good work, elſe they are but dead works, vnleſſe they be built vpon the foundation of Faith and Loue, eaſily will they be ſhaken.</p>
                     <p>Firſt, for Faith, it hath a ſpeciall ſtroke in euery <note place="margin">Euery good must be done in Faith, and</note> good action: For, firſt, it clenſeth the conſcience, and purifieth the heart, &amp; ſo fitteth it for the bring<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing forth of a good worke; for out of a defiled Fountayne, no pure Riuers can come. <hi>A good man brings forth good things:</hi> but whence? <hi>out of the good treaſure of his heart.</hi> Now this good treaſure is a worke of Faith, 1. <hi>Tim.</hi> 1. 6. <hi>Acts</hi> 15. 9.</p>
                     <pb n="114" facs="tcp:257:63"/>
                     <p> Secondly, it ſetteth before our eyes the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandement of God, enioyning vs that which is to be done, and withall perſwadeth vs, that the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandement belongs to vs, and bindes vs, <hi>Rom.</hi> 14. <hi>Whatſoeuer is not of Faith, is ſinne.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Thirdly, it ſharpneth the Commandement of God, ſet downe in that word, and driueth it in more deeply into our minds, by adding thereto a Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandement of her owne. For, as wee ſhewed be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, Faith to the regenerate, is in ſtead of a Law. Hence our obedience, <hi>Rom.</hi> 1 6. is called, <hi>the obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence of Faith,</hi> becauſe it harkneth not onely to the Word of God, but alſo to Faith, vrging and preſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing that Word of God. In euery good worke which wee doe, vnto the Commandement of the Word, muſt come the Co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mandement of our Faith. The which by the apprehenſion of the loue of God the Commander, ſweetly inuiteth and gently allu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth vs to performe obedience. Wicked men are moued ſometimes by Gods Commandement, to doe ſome good things, but yet not by the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandement of Faith, they haue none at all. Vnleſſe therefore when thou goeſt, commeſt, doeſt this or that, thou heare thy Faith, like the Centurion in the Goſpel, ſaying, <hi>Goe, Come, Doe this,</hi> or that, aſſuredly, thy comming, thy going, thy doing this or that, though grou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ded vpon the Word, are yet ſins in thee.</p>
                     <p>Fourthly &amp; fiftly, it preſenteth to our memories the Promiſes. Firſt, the promiſes more ſpecially to that particular good work, which is to be don. This is a notable ſpur to our obedience. Vnto this Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandement,
<pb n="115" facs="tcp:257:63"/> 
                        <hi>Apoc.</hi> 2. 10. <hi>Be thou faithfull to the death,</hi> is added this Promiſe, <hi>I will giue thee the Crowne of life.</hi> Now, that wee may more cheerfully obey this Commandement, our Faith, as MOSES his did, <hi>Heb.</hi> 11. muſt behold the Promiſe annexed.</p>
                     <p>Secondly, the Promiſes that are made generally to all good works, concerning the couering of their defects and blemiſhes. For the beſt works we do, are tainted and ſtayned with our naturall corruption. Here then is the laſt action of Faith, the vpſhot and concluſion of all<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> namely, the apprehenſion of the merits of Chriſt, whereby both that euill which we haue mixt with our good works, may be remo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued, and that good which is wanting, may be ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plyed.</p>
                     <p>In the ſecond place; when Faith ſhall thus haue <note place="margin">In loue, both to God and</note> done her part, comes Loue, ſucceeding and ſecon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding Faith, in the bringing forth of euery good worke.</p>
                     <p>Firſt, Loue towards God: For this is the diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence betwixt the obedience of the godly, and that ſhew of obedience that is to be found in the Eth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicks, Papiſts, Ciuill men, and all ſuch Iuſtitiaries. The loue of God thruſteth forward the godly, but theſe the loue of themſelues; for they thinke to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merit God to themſelues by that they doe. And therefore they ſay with that young man in the Goſ<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>pell, <hi>What good thing ſhall I doe, that I may get eternall life?</hi> Loe, the baſe mind of a ſeruile Mercenarie, they doe all like hyrelings for their wages. But a child like ingenuitie drawes forth the obedience of
<pb n="116" facs="tcp:257:64"/> the godly. The child, when hee does any thing for his Father, lookes for no recompence; but his in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent is onely to ſhew his loue towards his Father. The obedience of the godly is wholy Filiall, and a teſtimonie of their thankfulneſſe for benefits alrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die receiued. Therefore their voice is not. What good thing ſhall I doe for the getting of Life, but for Life already gotten? <hi>What ſhall I render to the Lord? Pſal</hi> 116.</p>
                     <p>Secondly, Loue alſo to our Brethren, muſt be <note place="margin">Our Brethren.</note> the ground of our obedience. This, as it is plaine in the works of the ſecond Table, wherein that of the Apoſtle hath place, <hi>Doe ſeruice one to another by loue;</hi> ſo it is true alſo in the works of the firſt Table. Euen thoſe works of obedience which con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerne God immediately, muſt be done in loue to our Brethren, namely, that by our example wee may doe good vnto them, prouoking them to doe the like. Thus PAVL in his ſufferings for the Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pell, had a ſpeciall regard of the Elect, 2. <hi>Tim.</hi> 2. <hi>verſ.</hi> 10.</p>
                     <p>Thus much of theſe Vertues of <hi>Faith</hi> and <hi>Loue.</hi> Their <hi>obiects</hi> follow.</p>
                     <p>Firſt, the <hi>obiect</hi> of Faith is onely one, <hi>viz. Christ.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>How is Chriſt the <hi>obiect</hi> of Faith? <label type="milestone">
                           <seg type="milestoneunit">Queſt. </seg>
                        </label>
                     </p>
                     <p>Faith is taken two wayes: Firſt, <hi>properly</hi> for an <label type="milestone">
                           <seg type="milestoneunit">Anſw. </seg>
                        </label> action of the Vnderſtanding, in aſſenting to ſome <note place="margin">Chriſt, the obiect of Faith.</note> truth. Secondly, <hi>improperly,</hi> and Metonymi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cally, for an act of the Will, in reſting and relying vpon ſome thing which is called <hi>Confidence,</hi>
                        <pb n="117" facs="tcp:257:64"/> which way ſoeuer wee take it, Iuſtifying faith hath Chriſt her obiect. Firſt, if it be taken for aſſent, which we call beliefe, or credence, Chriſt may worthily be accounted the obiect thereof, for this is the truth whereto ſhee aſſenteth, namely, that Chriſt is hers. If it be taken the ſecond way for <hi>confidence,</hi> ſo alſo is Chriſt the obiect of Faith, for in the merits of Chriſt onely, and nought elſe, can wee ſafely repoſe any truſt, of him may wee depend onely for our ſaluation.</p>
                     <p>Here then, firſt of all is ouerthrowne the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine of the Scholemen, that make God ſimply the obiect of our Faith, without making any mention of Chriſt, who yet is the Way, by the which we goe to the Father, otherwiſe dwelling in the light inac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſible: ſo our Sauiour, <hi>Ioh.</hi> 14. 1. <hi>You beleeue in God, beleeue alſo in mee.</hi> As if hee ſhould ſay, Yee cannot truely beleeue in the Father, vnleſſe alſo yee beleeue in mee: ſo moſt excellently are both theſe coupled together, <hi>Ioh.</hi> 17. 3. <hi>The knowledge of the Father, and of whom hee hath ſent, Ieſus Christ.</hi> So, 1. <hi>Pet.</hi> 1. <hi>verſ.</hi> 21. <hi>By whom</hi> (namely Chriſt) <hi>you beleeue in God.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>By this ſee then, what to iudge of the faith of the Turks, Iewes, and all thoſe that know not Chriſt, yea, of the Papiſts, deſtroying that Chriſt indeed, whom they grant in word. The way of God is hedged vp, conſidered in himſelfe, ſimply without Chriſt. He only is the foundation of Faith.</p>
                     <p>Secondly, here againe the Papiſts are met with that dare ioyne with CHRISTS merits, of Saints,
<pb n="118" facs="tcp:257:65"/> for Faith to leane vpon. But it is Chriſt onely that Faith can leane vpon. In him onely can ſhee find that, which is to be oppoſed to the Lawes rigour, to Gods anger and iuſtice. Therefore it is often<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times called the Faith of Ieſus Chriſt, as <hi>Rom.</hi> 3. It is only the bloud of Chriſt that will ſtay and ſtreng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then our hearts in the houre of death, and it is only that which will choke Satan with his temptations. Tell him of the merits of Saints, and hee will an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwere thee, as once thoſe Exorciſts, <hi>Acts</hi> 19. <hi>Ieſus I know, but theſe merits I know not.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Thirdly, this Doctrine of the obiect of Faith is the rather to be marked, that we may more cleerly vnderſtand the doctrine of our iuſtification by faith. For the Papiſts alwayes haue it in their mouthes, that Faith is a worke, and ſo, if wee be iuſtified by Faith, then by Works. But with Faith wee muſt ioyne the obiect of Faith, <hi>viz.</hi> Chriſt: for Faith iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtifies not in regard of the <hi>ſubiect,</hi> in which it <hi>inhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth;</hi> but of the <hi>obiect,</hi> to which it <hi>adhereth,</hi> not as a qualitie created in the mind, nor as an action of this qualitie (for both are imperfect) but as it applyeth Chriſt; and ſo in him couereth as all other defects, ſo alſo her owne, whereby ſhee is diſabled from iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtifying in her ſelfe. This Doctrine is full of com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort to thoſe that are diſcouraged, in regard of the ſmall meaſure of their Faith. But it is not the mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure of thy Faith, or the ſtrength of thy Faith that iuſtifies, but Chriſt apprehended by thy Faith, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſtrong or weake. And a Palſie-trembling hand will receiue an almes, as well as a ſtronger. So the
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:257:65"/> ſquint-eyed or purblind Iſraelite was healed by the looking on the brazen Serpent, as well as they whoſe eyes were better.</p>
                     <p>Laſtly, from this manner of phraſe, wherein Chriſt is made the obiect of Faith, namely, <hi>Faith in Christ.</hi> Some doe gather that Faith properly is an act of the will, reſting it ſelfe on Chriſt, and not of the vnderſtanding, beleeuing the Truth of the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe in particular: for then, they ſay, the Scripture ſhould rather ſpeake thus, <hi>Faith to Chriſt,</hi> and to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeue Chriſt, and not in Chriſt. This particle, <hi>In,</hi> they thinke argueth that confidence which we haue in Chriſt, whereby we caſt our ſelues vpon him, and as it were, goe into him. But theſe men ſeeme to me to be deceiued: for,</p>
                     <p>Firſt, it is moſt certayne that this particle <hi>(In)</hi> is <note place="margin">1. <hi>Three Reaſons, prouing Faith to be an act of the <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nderſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding, as well as of the Will.</hi>
                        </note> often giuen to the Faith of perſons vnregenerate, who haue not that confidence in Chriſt, as <hi>Ioh.</hi> 2. 23. <hi>Many beleeued in his Name ſeeing his miracles:</hi> where, by beleeuing in his Name, is meant onely that cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence which they gaue to Chriſt as a true Prophet, and no Deceiuer, which was wrung from them by force of his miracles: for heare Chriſts iudgement of them in the next Verſe: <hi>Ieſus would not commit himſelfe vnto them, for he knew what was in the heart of man;</hi> where they that before are ſaid to beleeue in his Name, are cloſely touched for their hollow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe and perfidiouſneſſe. If they had put their truſt in Chriſt, Chriſt (queſtionleſſe) would haue put more truſt in them then he did. So <hi>Exod.</hi> 14. <hi>ver.</hi> 31. <hi>They beleeued</hi> in MOSES, as it is in the Hebrew, that
<pb n="120" facs="tcp:257:66"/> is, they beleeued MOSES, as the learned haue well expounded it. Certainly, to beleeue in Chriſt, and to beleeue Chriſt, ſounded all one in the eares of thoſe Iewes, that conferred with Chriſt, <hi>Iohn</hi> 6. for whereas <hi>Verſe</hi> 29. Chriſt had ſaid, <hi>This is the worke of God, that yee beleeue in him whom he hath ſent,</hi> they preſently anſwere, <hi>What ſigne doeſt thou ſhew that wee may ſee, and beleeue thee?</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Secondly, the Scripture diſtinguiſheth Faith and <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> Confidence very plainly, <hi>By whom we haue acceſſe with confidence by faith, Epheſ.</hi> 3. 12. Now, it would be abſurd for the Apoſtle to ſay, Wee haue acceſſe with confidence by confidence.</p>
                     <p>Thirdly, Reaſon it ſelfe is againſt this opinion: <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> for how can we rely vpon him, of whoſe good will towards vs wee are not perſwaded? Firſt, wee muſt beleeue that Chriſt is ours, and loueth vs, before we can be able to commit our ſelues vnto him, for the will and affections follow the vnderſtanding.</p>
                     <p>Yet, I denie not, but that oftentimes, yea very vſually in the Scripture, this Confidence is put for Faith, becauſe it is an immediate, and moſt excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent fruit of Faith. For when once the vnderſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding ſhall iudge of the truth and goodneſſe of the Promiſe, the wil forthwith muſt needs claſpe about them. And withall wee feele diuers times this acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of our wills in cleauing to the Promiſes, when yet wee feele not ſo cleerly the action of our vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding, in aſſenting vnto them. But our feeling muſt not be the rule to determine matters by; wee feele Repentance before Faith, which is yet a fruit
<pb n="121" facs="tcp:257:66"/> of Faith, and commonly we feele the effects before the cauſes themſelues. As wee ſee and diſcerne the light of the Candle, before the Candle it ſelfe; and yet the candle in order of nature is firſt. Thus much for the <hi>obiect</hi> of Faith.</p>
                     <p>Now of Loues <hi>obiects.</hi> They are two: The <note place="margin">Obiects of Loue, two:</note> former ſhee hath in common with Faith, <hi>viz. Christ.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>The latter, proper to her ſelfe, and <hi>all Saints.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>The firſt <hi>obiect</hi> of our loue, is <hi>Christ,</hi> who is to <note place="margin">Firſt, Chriſt.</note> be loued in many reſpects.</p>
                     <p>Firſt, <hi>As he is God,</hi> for himſelfe. For the matter of loue is good, Chriſt being God, the chiefe good, in whom lye hid all the Treaſures of goodneſſe; he is to be loued chiefly and aboue all.</p>
                     <p>Secondly, <hi>As he is our Lord,</hi> which reſpect the Apoſtle may ſeeme to inſinuate here, ſaying, to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards <hi>our Lord Ieſus.</hi> Good is to be loued, in, and for it ſelfe, but much more when that which is good in it ſelfe, ſhall be good alſo to vs, from whence ariſeth this title of <hi>Lord</hi> here giuen him: for, firſt, Hee created vs of nothing, good and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect in our kind. Secondly, Falling away from this perfection, hee hath reſtored vs to an eſtate better then the former: being reſtored, he preſerues vs in it, and reſerues vs for eternall glorie, in the meane time lading vs daily with his bleſſings. Here then is place for that Song of DAVID, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 18. 1, 2. <hi>I loue the Lord, he is my Rocke:</hi> and, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 116. <hi>I loue the Lord, he hath heard my prayer.</hi> Thirdly, <hi>As he is our Brother,</hi> not only becauſe we are all as ADAM, <hi>Luk.</hi> 3
<pb n="122" facs="tcp:257:67"/> in the end, the ſonnes of God by creation, and hee hath the ſame humane nature with vs, created by God, but alſo by adoption, and that through his meanes.</p>
                     <p>But wherein conſiſts our Loue of Chriſt? <label type="milestone">
                           <seg type="milestoneunit">Queſt. </seg>
                        </label>
                     </p>
                     <p>In Loue, there are eſpecially theſe two things: <label type="milestone">
                           <seg type="milestoneunit">Anſw. </seg>
                        </label> firſt, the violent running and ruſhing, as it were, of <note place="margin">Wherein the loue of Chriſt conſiſts.</note> the deſire to the thing we loue, that we may enioy it: ſecondly, the reſting of the mind, and the reioy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing of the heart in it, after once we haue obtained it. Would we then know how to loue Chriſt? Firſt, before all other things, thou muſt with great ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſtneſſe, and contention of deſire, long after Chriſt, and that in two reſpects: <hi>firſt,</hi> that thou mayeſt come to him, and be vnited by Faith, as PAVL, <hi>Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lip.</hi> 3. being deſirous to redeeme Chriſts righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe with the loſſe of all other things whatſoeuer: <hi>ſecondly,</hi> that he may come to thee by ſight, and take thee into his owne Companie in the Heauen; as PAVL alſo did, <hi>Phil.</hi> 1. <hi>I deſire to be diſſolued, and to be with Chriſt.</hi> Againe, thou muſt feele thy heart reioycing in Chriſt, euen in that apprehenſion of him which thou haſt in this life, feeling the want of all other things made vp in him, and ſo fully con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenting thy ſelfe with his loue: elſe thou doeſt no more loue Chriſt, then that woman her husband, which receiuing ſmall contentment from him, deſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth the companie of other men. This was in PAVL, 1. <hi>Cor.</hi> 15. 31. calling Chriſt, <hi>his reioycing.</hi> And when we feele theſe things, then may we truly call Chriſt our Loue, as IGNATIVS did, ſaying, <hi>His Loue was</hi>
                        <pb n="123" facs="tcp:257:67"/> 
                        <hi>crucified.</hi> But if theſe things be wanting; no hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gring, no thirſting after Chriſt, and his Righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe; no reioycing, nor reſting of the heart in Chriſt; but we linger in our deſire after worldly things, and find more comfort in them, then in Chriſt, nor yet no deſiring for the comming of Chriſt to Iudgement; it is an argument, that in truth there is no loue of Chriſt in vs.</p>
                     <p>Againe obſerue, as before concerning Faith the ſame thing was obſerued, That not God ſimply and abſolutely in himſelfe, but God in Chriſt, is the ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iect of our Loue. I graunt indeed, that wee owe Loue to God, as in himſelfe he is good, and as our Creator, though he ſhould neuer haue further ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſted his Loue vnto vs in Chriſt. But wee can in no wiſe pay this debt of Loue, but vnto God, conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered in Chriſt. The reaſon is, becauſe our Loue of him ariſeth of his loue to vs, as S. IOHN witneſſeth. And he loues vs onely in Chriſt, <hi>Matth.</hi> 3. in the end. The Iewes that denyed Chriſt, pretended a zealous Loue of God, but the Apoſtle worthily condemnes it: for no man can truely loue God, out of Chriſt. Vainely therefore doe all Papiſts, and all prophane Proteſtants, brag of their Loue to God. The ſecond Obiect of our Loue followes.</p>

Wee may loue God in the Creature. God indeed is onely good originally, and of himſelfe, yet he imparteth his goodneſſe to his Creatures. And this deriued goodneſſe of the Creature, is Gods owne good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe. And therefore it followeth on the contrary, that becauſe we muſt loue God, therefore alſo the Creature, the baſeſt Creature that is, hauing ſome obſcure Lineaments of the Image of God.</p>
                        <p>Firſt, Marke the Order of our Loue: Firſt, it <label type="milestone">
                              <seg type="milestoneunit">Doct. </seg>1</label> muſt be directly carried to God; then, to the Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture: <note place="margin">The Order of our Loue.</note> to Chriſt, the Head; then, to the Saints, the members. All Creatures therefore are to be loued in God, and for God onely: ſo that the Loue of the Creature muſt be ſo farre from taking any thing from our Loue of God, that rather it muſt confirme and encreaſe the ſame. And then is the loue of the Creature lawfull, when it is referred to the Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor: So that wee loue not ſo much the Creature, as the Creator in the Creature. Now this is done <note place="margin">Two wayes how the Creator is loued in the Creature.</note> theſe two wayes:</p>
                        <p>Firſt, in regard <hi>of the Beginning,</hi> from whom the Loue of the Creature ariſeth; namely, the Loue of God, for whoſe cauſe wee loue the Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
<pb n="125" facs="tcp:257:68"/> his Workmanſhip, as the Sonne for the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers cauſe.</p>
                        <p>Secondly, in regard <hi>of the End</hi> to which it ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth. Now that Loue of the Creature which is law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full, tendeth to the Loue of the Creator: For the glorie of God is that end which we muſt propound to all our actions, and ſo conſequently, to our Loue of any Creature. And this muſt be the end of all thoſe duties of Loue which we are to performe to our brethren, that by that meanes we may prouoke them to the Loue of God. If wee loue the Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture otherwiſe then thus, we ſinne grieuouſly, in as much we cleaue to the Creature, and contrarie to that of the Pſalmiſt, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 62. <hi>We ſet our heart vpon it,</hi> which God claymeth as his owne peculiaritie.</p>
                        <p>The Riuers that come out of the Sea, as they paſſe, doe lightly touch the Earth; but they ſtay not there, but goe on forward, till at laſt they returne a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine into that Sea, from whence they firſt came. So it is here, our Loue muſt firſt come from God to the Creature; but being ſo come, it muſt not reſt and ſettle there (howſoeuer, like a Riuer, it may in paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſage touch it;) no; it muſt returne backe into that infinite Sea, euen God himſelfe, whence firſt it came. But how many ſhall we ſee ſo blinded and bewit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched with the Loue of the Creature, that God is wholly forgotten of them! Thus is God robbed of his Honor, with the Loue of whom only, the heart is to be poſſeſſed, and wholly taken vp; and the Creature abuſed, and transformed into an Idoll. For, for this cauſe is Couetouſneſſe called <hi>Idolatrie,</hi>
                           <pb n="126" facs="tcp:257:69"/> becauſe it glueth and faſteneth the heart to Riches. Now the adhering of the heart, is proper onely to God. Therefore alſo is the exceſſiue Loue of the Creature called <hi>Adulterie,</hi> becauſe thereby we with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>draw our affections from Chriſt, our Spirituall Husband, <hi>Iames</hi> 4. 4. <hi>O yee Adulterers and Adul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſſes, know yee not, that the Loue of the World, is Enmitie with God?</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>Let vs take heed of being enamoured with any Creature, though neuer ſo glorious and pleaſing vnto vs, forgetting in the meane time the Creator, Bleſſed for euer. If it ſhall pleaſe God to take from vs any Creature we loue, as our Children, Wiues, Husbands, Goods, Health, Credit, &amp;c. which hee doth oftentimes, becauſe he ſeeth we loue them too well; let vs willingly ſuffer our ſelues to be ſeuered from them. Let no man, in the loſſe of Children, crie out with DAVID, as bereft of reaſon; ABSA<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>LOM, ABSALOM, <hi>O my ſonne</hi> ABSALOM, <hi>would God I had died for thee!</hi> or with RAHEL, feed their ſorrow, wilfully refuſing comfort: for then wee ſhew plainely, wee loued the Creature for it ſelfe. If wee loued it for Gods cauſe, and rather loued God in it, then it ſelfe alone; wee ſhould then, with AARON, without any more adoe, <hi>hold our peace, Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uit.</hi> 10. For though thy Sonne, thy Spouſe, thy Wife, whom thou louedſt as thine owne ſoule, dearely and tenderly, be taken away from thee; yet God, whom thou loueſt in them, ſtill remayneth with thee. Therefore, if the preſence of God cannot comfort thee, in the abſence of the Creature which thou lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uedſt,
<pb n="127" facs="tcp:257:69"/> nor thou canſt not yeeld quietly to God, par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting thee and the Creature which thou loueſt; it is a plaine argument, thou art too farre gone in thy Loue. For when wee keepe this our Loue of the Creature within her lawfull bounds, then ſhall wee not onely be well content, that God ſhould make a Diuorce betwixt it and vs, but we our ſelues will be readie, in caſe hee commaunds vs, to giue a Bill of Diuorcement into it hands, willingly to depriue our ſelues of the ſame. This is that which our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiour calls, the hating of Father, Mother, Wife, Children, and Life it ſelfe, when as wee ſeeing God calls for them at our hands, becauſe wee cannot both keepe them and a good conſcience too, wee doe willingly reſigne them vp. Thus did ABRA<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>HAM chearefully ſacrifice ISAAC; PAVL, his life, <hi>Acts</hi> 20. MOSES, his honours, <hi>Heb.</hi> 11. thereby plainely ſhewing, that in truth they loued the Lord in theſe Creatures, ſimply in themſelues, becauſe they were ſo willing to forgoe them, when God called for them. And therefore God himſelfe ſaid to ABRAHAM, <hi>Now I know that thou loueſt mee.</hi> Now I ſee, that there is no Creature, no, not ISAAC himſelfe, that is able to alienate and eſtrange thy affections from mee. Now I ſee, that howſoeuer thou LOUEDſT ISAAC well, yet thou louedſt me bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, and ISAAC onely for my ſake, when at my com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maund thou canſt euen hate him.</p>
                        <p>Secondly, The Apoſtle conioyning the Loue of <label type="milestone">

                           <pb n="128" facs="tcp:257:70"/> and that in truth, none loueth Chriſt, who alſo lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueth not his Members: for wee may truely ſay with DAVID, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 16. 2. <hi>Lord, my well-doing reacheth not to thee; All my delight is in the Saints on Earth.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>The Lord Ieſus is in the Heauens. We cannot ſo manifeſtly declare our Loue to his owne Perſon; but he hath left, in his owne ſtead, a moſt fit Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter for our Loue, the poore Saints to be with vs al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes. Whereas, if thoſe duties of kindneſſe and humanitie, which IOSEPH of <hi>Arimathea</hi> perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med to the dead Corps of our Sauiour, were argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of his Loue, how much more ſhall wee de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare our Loue vnto him, in helping the Church, his liuing Bodie, his Fulneſſe, called by the Name of Chriſt himſelfe, 1. <hi>Cor.</hi> 12. ſpecially then, when it ſhall be in ieopardie? If the glorified Bodie of Chriſt in the Heauens were here vpon Earth with vs, no doubt wee would be very officious and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpectiue of it. But alas, it is not that Maſſe of fleſh, though glorified and vnited to his Godhead, which hee ſo much reſpects: No; hee makes greater ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of his faithfull Ones amongſt vs; ſetting that vpon his owne Skore, which is done vnto them. Euerie one of theſe hath hee honoured with his Name, as well as the whole Companie of them. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 105. 15. <hi>Touch not my Prophets, neither hurt my Chriſts.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>Vainely therefore doe they prattle, that ſpeake of their Loue to Chriſt, who yet are wanting to his Members in their Troubles; ſuffering PAVL to
<pb n="129" facs="tcp:257:70"/> anſwer for himſelfe before NERO, and with the Parents of the blind man, <hi>Ioh.</hi> 9. ſaying, <hi>Hee is old ynough, let him ſpeake for himſelfe.</hi> To ſuch I ſay, <hi>If any man loue not the Lord Ieſus, let him be accurſed,</hi> 1. <hi>Cor.</hi> 16.</p>
                        <p>Thirdly, Obſerue, who, next vnto Chriſt, are to <label type="milestone">
                              <seg type="milestoneunit">Doct. </seg>3</label> be loued; namely, the <hi>Saints.</hi> All men, being of <note place="margin">The Saints to be loued, next vnto Chriſt.</note> the ſame mould, the ſame humane nature with our ſelues, are to be loued; for wee may not hide our ſelues from our owne fleſh. But the chiefetie of our Loue is due vnto the Saints, that are of the ſame Spirituall fleſh and conſanguinitie with vs. Others may not haue the tythe of that Loue they haue. <hi>Let vs doe good to all</hi> (ſayth the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtle) <hi>but ſpecially to the Houſehold of Faith, Ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lat.</hi> 6.</p>
                        <p>1. <hi>Tim.</hi> 5. <hi>Hee that prouideth not for his owne, is</hi> 
                           <label type="milestone">

                           <hi>worſe then an Infidell.</hi> But a mans owne (haply) may be none of the Saints. S. PAVL here ſeemes to preferre a mans owne, though neuer ſo wicked, in our Loue, before the Saints.</p>
                        <p>If the Queſtion be, Whether I muſt rather helpe my wicked Wife in her neceſſitie, then any godly friend? this place to TIMOTHIE, ſayes, My wicked Wife. But here the Apoſtle giues the firſt place of our Loue, next to CHRIST, vnto the Saints.</p>
                        <p>This Doctrine, That our Loue muſt chiefely <label type="milestone">
                              <seg type="milestoneunit">Anſw. </seg>
                           </label> reſpect the Saints, is to be vnderſtood in an euen Compariſon. All Saints are not to be preferred before all that are none; but thoſe onely, that
<pb n="130" facs="tcp:257:71"/> may equally be compared with them: as, Thoſe of mine owne, which are godly, muſt bee loued more then thoſe of mine owne, which are not. I muſt loue all my Children, Seruants, Kinsfolkes, but ſpecially thoſe that are Saints. But in an vne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quall Compariſon, it holdeth not. An vngodly Sonne, Wife, Brother, &amp;c. is to be reſpected before a godly friend, that is further off from me, and not ſo neere in bloud.</p>
                        <p>Againe, though naturall affection may be grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter in vs towards our Kinsfolkes wicked, then towards ſtrangers godly; yet true Chriſtian Loue belongeth to the Faithfull, without any carnall reſpect: Neyther muſt wee meaſure it ſo much by outward effects, as by the inward affection of the mind: It is a Spirituall Loue, and is ſpecially ſeene in Spirituall Things; as, in the holy cleauing of hearts together in mutuall Prayers, Conſolati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, and heauenly Conferences.</p>
                        <p>And thus I may loue my Chriſtian friends more then my vngodly Wife, or Children, though in nouriſhing of them, I ſuffer them to periſh with famine, as not hauing ſufficient to relieue both.</p>
                        <p>Fourthly, Marke; The Obiect of PHILE<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>MONS <label type="milestone">

But if wee loue but
<pb n="131" facs="tcp:257:71"/> one Saint, becauſe of his Grace, wee muſt needes carrie the ſame mind to all. Otherwiſe; if lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing one, wee hate another, it is an argument wee loue him not becauſe he is a Saint, for then wee ſhould loue the other alſo, but for other re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpects.</p>
                        <p>Here then is condemned that partialitie, which IAMES taxeth, <hi>Iames</hi> 2.</p>
                        <p>Fifthly, Obſerue, That the Chriſtians with <label type="milestone">

Wee are not then to reſtraine this name to the glorified Soules of iuſt and perfect men in Heauen. Certainely, vnleſſe thou art a liuing Saint, thou ſhalt neuer be a Saint when thou art dead; for that Holineſſe which is perfected then, is begun here.</p>
                        <p>Let now thoſe prophane Knaues goe and ſcorne the Name of a Saint, together with all Sanctimonie; in the meane time, they themſelues being ſcorned by Him that ſitteth in the Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uens.</p>

In this Verſe, and the ſeuenth, they are deſcribed ſeuerally. And firſt, his Prayer in this ſixt Verſe, from the <hi>matter</hi> of it.

                     <p>For the firſt, That Efficacie of Faith which here PAVL deſireth for PHILEMON, was two: Firſt, in regard of PHILEMON himſelfe, that it might worke effectually in him: ſecondly, in regard of others, that it might be examplarie to them, and ſo might be effectuall in prouoking them to the like.</p>
                     <p>And that the Apoſtle had ſome reference, e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen to this latter kind of Efficacie, the words fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing ſeeme to import, <hi>That whatſoeuer good thing is in you, may be knowne:</hi> For when the light of our Faith ſhineth to others, it very effectually ſtirreth them vp to the glorifying of GODS Name, <hi>Matth.</hi> 5.</p>

A ſlouthfull kind of Sleepineſſe may ſometimes ſeize vpon it, and vnfit and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able it for Spirituall Exerciſes. As wee ſee in the Diſciples; who being oppreſſed with carnall griefe for the departure of CHRIST now at hand,
<pb n="134" facs="tcp:257:73"/> were not able to attend the Exerciſe of Prayer, no, not one houre, with our Sauiour. So likewiſe in the <hi>Philippians, Phil.</hi> 4. 10. Of whom, when the Apoſtle ſayes, That they were reuiued, or, as the word ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifies, waxen greene, or freſh againe, in their Loue and Liberalitie towards him; thereby he declareth, That for a time they were like Trees, that in the Winter are in their Widow-hood, hauing loſt their Leaues, and appearing outwardly as dead, all their Sappe being in the Root within. And truely, as Trees, ſo Faith alſo, hath her Winter, namely, the Stormes and Tempeſts of Temptations, which by their violence ſhake off all her greene and glorious Leaues, and ſo make her appeare naked and deſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late, ſhee being driuen into the ſecret corners of the heart, and there for a time to lye gaſping and pan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting, readie to giue vp the ghoſt.

Nay, then it is Holy-day, and Vacation-time with her, till ſhee recouer her ſelfe againe. Therefore PAVL here prayeth, that PHILEMONS Faith might bee preſerued from this Lethargie and Sleepi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, to the which, in it ſelfe, it was ſubiect, and ſo might ſhew it ſelfe to be a liuely and effectuall Faith.</p>

Therefore here PAVL prayeth for PHILEMON, That his Faith might bee effectuall. And if o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther mens Prayers may doe this, much more our owne.</p>
                     <p>But it may ſeeme, that Faith muſt rather giue <label type="milestone">

                        </label> receiueth. It is the ſtrength of the bodie, whereby it moueth and ſtirreth, and yet by this motion it is confirmed and encreaſed. If thy legge be benum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med, goe vpon it a little, and it will come to it ſelfe; ſo if thy Faith be as it were benummed, cauſe it to moue and ſtirre in this holy Exerciſe of Prayer, and thou ſhalt find preſently her ſpirits returning againe to her, and the Coales, before couered vnder the aſhes, by theſe bellowes to be blowne vp, and conceiue a flame: For Prayer is a notable preſerua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiue againſt Spirituall ſlumber, preſcribed by the moſt skilfull Phyſician, ſaying, <hi>Watch and pray, that yee enter not into temptation.</hi>

                           <seg type="milestoneunit">Doct. </seg>3</label> true Faith in his owne nature is effectuall, liuely, <note place="margin">Faith is a liuely Grace.</note> full of vigour and ſpirits. 1. <hi>Theſſal.</hi> 1. <hi>verſ.</hi> 3. <hi>The worke of your faith,</hi> that is, your working Faith. Faith is of a working and ſtirring diſpoſition, and is alwayes quicke-ſpirited and nimble, vnleſſe when it bee wounded by ſome grieuous temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation.</p>
                     <p>Thy faith then, which like the Sluggard, hol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth her hands in her boſome, loth to ſtirre out of doores, which alwayes lyes dreaming within, lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding an idle ſedentarie life; this Faith, I ſay, which is of ſo heauy a mold, of ſuch leaden heeles, is a falſe faith, what ſhewes ſoeuer it haue. For ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiueneſſe is the property of true Faith. I diſcerne the picture of a man, though neuer ſo liuely, to bee no true man, becauſe it ſtands ſtill and ſtirres not. Therefore, though it haue ſhew of eyes, mouth<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> feet, &amp;c. yet, when I ſee, it neither goes, ſees, nor ſpeakes, I know it is no man. So, when I looke vpon thy faith, and find for all the colours of outward profeſſion, that it is idle, I conclude forthwith, that it is an Idoll, a ſhaddow, void of truth, and ſubſtance.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Shew mee thy faith by thy works,</hi> ſaith IAMES. Indeed, if Pride, Swearing, prophaning of the Sabbaths, Vncleanneſſe, were fruits of faith, then theſe Braggers would iuſtifie their faith as very ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectuall.</p>
                     <pb n="137" facs="tcp:257:74"/>
                     <p> But ſince the fruits of Faith are<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Mortification, Meekeneſſe, Loue, &amp;c. and not the leaſt drop or dram of theſe Graces are to be ſeene in them, it appeareth, that their Faith is a very emptie and imaginatie Faith.</p>
                     <p>The ſecond followes; namely, wherein this <hi>Effi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cacie</hi> of Faith, here prayed for, conſiſts; firſt, in <hi>Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munication;</hi> ſecondly, in the <hi>knowledge of euery good thing.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>For the firſt, Obſerue, That Faith is no ſparing <label type="milestone">
                           <seg type="milestoneunit">Doct. </seg>1</label> Niggard, but of a very bountifull and liberall diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition. <note place="margin">Faith is a boun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifull grace, and communicatiue.</note> It hoordeth not, it hideth not thoſe Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures which ſhee receiueth of God, but commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicateth them to others; <hi>That the communication of thy Faith.</hi> For that which Chriſt ſaid to his Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples, Faith ſayth to her ſelfe, <hi>Freely haue I receiued, freely will I giue.</hi> This <hi>Communication</hi> therefore is a moſt neceſſarie effect of Faith, as the Apoſtle ſheweth in his owne example, <hi>Rom.</hi> 1. 12. <hi>That I might receiue Exhortation together with you<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> through our Faith.</hi> Faith is made the fountaine where-from that mutuall communication of Exhortation or Comfort, betwixt PAVL and the Romans, ſhould ſpring. If then thou wilt ſhew thy ſelfe to haue true Faith, let mee ſee the <hi>Communication of thy Faith.</hi> But this is very rare. Men are afraid, leſt by this meanes all their ſtore will be ſoone ſpent, and ſo they ſhall be drawne drie; wherein they are much wide: For here, not Parſimonie, which agreeth not with Faith, but this liberall <hi>Communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation</hi> of our gifts, is the beſt thrift and husbandry:
<pb n="138" facs="tcp:257:75"/> for as thoſe Loaues in the Goſpell, ſo our gifts en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſe and multiply, euen whileſt they are in diſtri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buting. Euen out of that which the hand reacheth to the mouth, it ſelfe is nouriſhed.</p>
                     <p>Againe, how ſhould we looke that others ſhould communicate to vs, if wee communicate not to them? Here then is another benefit of this commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nication, wee doe not encreaſe our owne, but gaine vnto our ſelues the benefit of our Brethren: By the helpe whereof wee ſhall bee enabled to doe that which of our ſelues alone we could neuer doe. The Blind, of himſelfe, cannot goe a iourney, neither yet the Lame man, the one for want of eyes, the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther for want of his legs. But now, if there be this <hi>communication</hi> betwixt them, the Blind man carry the Lame man on his backe, and ſo become legs to him, the Lame man lend his eyes to the Blind, and direct him in the way; by this meanes they will diſpatch that iourney, which apart, neither of them could haue done. God, of ſet purpoſe hath ſo diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed of his gifts, that we ſhould ſtand in need one of another, euen the Head of the Foot not giuing all to euery one; for then finding a ſufficiency in our ſelues, we would not ſeeke for helpe abroad, when we might haue it at home, but, one to this man<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other to that; that ſo this mutuall <hi>communication</hi> might be maintayned amongſt vs.</p>
                     <p>In theſe and many other reſpects, muſt wee haue ſpeciall care of this communication. Our owne gifts, by their vſe, will encreaſe; our Brethrens, in regard of vſe, will become ours; and both vnited
<pb n="139" facs="tcp:257:75"/> together, will be ſtronger; laying our Moneyes to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether, we ſhall make vp that ſhot, which by reaſon of our pouertie, we could not haue done apart.</p>
                     <p>The ſecond thing, wherein this <hi>efficacy</hi> of Faith conſiſteth, is the <hi>Knowledge of all that good.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>That Faith then is effectuall, which hath all o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther <label type="milestone">

                        </label> Graces at command; ſo that, when it ſayes to <note place="margin">Faith ſets all o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Graces on worke, and makes them manifeſt.</note> one, Goe, it goeth; to another, Come, it comes; to all of them, I would haue you knowne of others, they forthwith come forth into the open light, and by practice make themſelues knowne to all. If a King command, and be not obeyed, it ſhewes, his power is not great, that hee is not as yet throughly confirmed in his Authoritie. So, it is an argument that Faith, as yet is but weake, and of ſmall force, when it commands not with a Kingly and Imperi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all Majeſtie and Authoritie, ſo that without fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther delay his commands are obeyed. <hi>That thy faith may be effectuall:</hi> but how? In the knowledge of e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uery good thing that is in you.</p>
                     <p>Vnleſſe then, Faith doe thruſt forth all other Graces whatſoeuer in thee, and cauſe them in ſome manner to be ſeene, and acknowledged of others, thy Faith is vneffectuall. What then ſhall wee ſay of thoſe, who vaunt of their Faith, Hope, Loue, and other Graces, and yet they giue vs not the leaſt taſte of any of them? They ſay, they feele the power of theſe Graces within their hearts, though they haue not that gift that others haue, of making ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſt that which is in them. But in ſaying ſo, they bewray they haue not the gift of Faith at all. For
<pb n="140" facs="tcp:257:76"/> Faith cannot ſuffer Grace to lye incloſed and cloy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtered in the Cloſet of the breſt, but it will preſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly deliuer them out of this Priſon: if the doore be ſhut, it will breake it downe, and by force make way for them to come out. <hi>I beleeued, therefore I ſpake, Pſal.</hi> 116. Faith then is, as it were, the Porter, that opens the doore of the mouth, that when wee haue beleeued with the heart, with the mouth alſo we might confeſſe to ſaluation, <hi>Rom</hi> 10. and ſo not our hearts only, but <hi>our fleſh alſo might praiſe the Lord, Pſal.</hi> 104. It is to be doubted then, that thoſe Graces that loue thus to keepe their Chambers, are ſicke Graces: If they were healthy, they would delight to come abroad and take the ayre; for as Veritie, ſo likewiſe Vertue ſeeketh no corners. Nay, ſuch is the power of Faith, that it driues all grace out of corners, and cauſeth euery ſecret thing to be eui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent, and euery hid thing to come to light, <hi>Luk.</hi> 8. 17 for the Spirit of God once ſeated in our hearts, is like vnto Wine in new bottels, which will breake the bottels, but it will haue ſome vent, <hi>Iob</hi> 32. 19. and like to fire that cannot be pent in, but makes way for it ſelfe, and breakes out into open flame, <hi>Ierem.</hi> 20. Againe, others there are, not altogether drie and emptie of grace, as thoſe vaine vaunters, but endued with ſome good portion thereof, who yet doe deſerue iuſt reprehenſion, for that they doe not manifeſt euery good thing that is in them by Chriſt for as ſometimes we make ſemblance of that Grace wee haue not, ſo againe at other times, wee cloſely diſſemble and conceale that Grace which
<pb n="141" facs="tcp:257:76"/> we haue, ſometimes for feare of danger, as PETER did his zeale and affection to Chriſt; and NICO<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>DEMVS, who came by night, and ſo his light did not ſhine before men: ſomtimes againe, through an vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chriſtian, and indeed, ſhameful ſhamefaſtneſſe, thin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king it doth not become vs; ſo to put forth our ſelues, either by word or action: and laſt of all, through our owne negligence and careleſneſſe, whereby ſuffering Satan to ſurprize vs, wee are diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>abled for manifeſting our ſpirituall ſtrength. The ſtrongeſt Gyant that is, when he is faſt fettered and chained, and manacled, cannot ſhew his ſtrength, as long as hee is in that caſe; no more can wee, when through our want of watchfulneſſe, wee haue ſuffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red Satan to bind vs hand and foote, and withall haue baniſhed that good Spirit of grace, without whom we are able to doe nothing. Thus SAMSON, when he had yeelded to Satans temptations, in lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing the badge of his Profeſſion, and ſo had grieued the Spirit, was not able to ſhew his former ſtrength, howſoeuer he thought with himſelfe, to haue done as in former times. So it fares with vs, many a time wee thinke to giue proofe of this or that Grace, as wee haue done formerly, but when it comes to the tryall, wee doe nothing leſſe. Being, through our owne ſecuritie, hampered in Satans ſnares, wee are not able to ſtirre; and ſo now, not our grace, but our wants and weakneſſes are made known. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore let vs take heede of theſe three impediments, <hi>Feare, Baſhfulneſſe,</hi> and <hi>Careleſneſſe.</hi> Let vs inde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uour, not ſo much in word, which is Phariſaicall,
<pb n="142" facs="tcp:257:77"/> but ſpecially indeed, and in the whole courſe of our carriage to expreſſe the inward grace of our heart, that that may ſpeake when we hold our peace, that the prints and marks of that Humilitie, Loue, Meekneſſe, Sobrietie, Wiſedome, &amp;c. which are within vs, may euidently appeare in our ſeuerall ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, that ſo they which conuerſe with vs may haue experience of them, and ſo may giue vs that good teſtimonie, which the <hi>Philippians</hi> were able to giue TIMOTHY, <hi>Philip.</hi> 2. 22. This is that which the Apoſtle commanded the <hi>Philippians, Phil.</hi> 4. <hi>Let your patient mind be made knowne to all:</hi> and to TIMO<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>THY 1. 4, 15. <hi>That thy profiting may be made manifeſt to all:</hi> and our Sauiour to vs all, Let your light ſhine. Let vs not violently ſmother and ſuppreſſe the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit in our ſelues. Let vs not detayne in vniuſt capti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uitie the graces of God, deſirous to breake forth. Let vs not deſire to keepe the light of the Candle within the Lanthorne onely. Let vs not ſet the Candle, which GOD hath lighted in vs, vnder a Buſhell, or vnder the Table, but in the Candleſtick of all our outward actions: but yet not for oſtenta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, that wee might haue a name: but, firſt, that <note place="margin">Foure ends of the manifeſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Grace.</note> God may be glorified, <hi>Mat.</hi> 5. Secondly, our Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren ſtrengthned &amp; confirmed; yea, and thoſe that as yet are without, may be gayned by our good ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample. Thirdly, the mouth of the malicious watch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing for occaſion of ſlander, may be ſtopped, 1. <hi>Pet.</hi> 2. 15. Fourthly, we may acquite our ſelues as true Iſraelites, approuing to be that in truth which wee profeſſe, for otherwiſe wee giue iuſt occaſion to bee ſuſpected of Hypocriſie.</p>

                     <p> But here marke, that not euery good thing that <note place="margin">All good in vs is not to be made knowne.</note> comes from vs, muſt be made knowne; as our pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uate Prayers, good Thoughts, Meditations, De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſires, &amp;c. Theſe things we muſt keepe ſecret to our ſelues, as doing them to our Father that ſees in ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cret, who alſo will reward vs openly, and not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueale them to others, vnleſſe vpon ſome ſpeciall occaſion, as PETER, and CORNELIVS, <hi>Acts</hi> 10. and IOHN, <hi>Apocalyp.</hi> 1. 10. did. But thoſe good Graces, which are in vs, as Loue, Zeale, Patience, &amp;c. muſt be made knowne, and that not ſo much by prating as practiſing, and yet not alwayes, but as occaſion ſhall ſerue, and in diſcretion. <hi>Pro.</hi> 25. <hi>verſ.</hi> 11. <hi>A word ſpoken in due ſeaſon, is like Apples of gold with pictures of ſiluer.</hi> Pſal. 1. 3. <hi>That bring forth fruit in due ſeaſon.</hi>

<pb n="146" facs="tcp:257:79"/> likewiſe ſtirre vs vp to thankſgiuing: but you will ſay, The wicked take great delight in miſchiefe. <hi>It is a paſtime to a Foole, to doe wickedly.</hi> Muſt they then giue thanks for their wickedneſſe? God forbid. Vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand this of a lawfull and iuſt ioy, comming from God, and not of an euill ioy comming from <hi>Satan:</hi> for the end of that ioy is heauineſſe, <hi>Pro.</hi> 14. and not thankſgiuing; it being a ſinne, muſt driue vs to a ſorrowfull confeſſion of ſinne, and not to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny cheerfull praiſing of Gods Name. But in a law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full and holy ioy it holds, ſuch as is the ioy, ariſing out of the works of Gods Wiſedome and Mercy, whether done to vs, or by vs to others, or by o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers.</p>
                     <p>They are wickedly vngratefull, who when God ſhall haue cheered and reuiued their ſpirits by his mercies, doe not make their ioy and cheerfulneſſe a whetſtone for thankſgiuing, but rather for wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tonneſſe, and vncleanneſſe, and vanitie of ſpeech. As wee ſee many, when God at the Table hath fil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led their hearts with food and gladneſſe, in the ſtrength of their ioyfull ſpirits quicken their wits to ſweare, blaſpheme, reuile, and reproch the Saints, and not once to bleſſe Gods name for his creatures, that haue refreſhed and reuiued their ſpirits. This is a prophane and carnall ioy, though otherwiſe lawfull in it ſelfe, which reſteth only in the creature, and aduanceth not vp the mind to the Creatour: whereas wee ſhould reioyce more in the good will of the Giuer, then in the gift.</p>
                     <p>Let vs then haue a ſpeciall eye to this affection
<pb n="147" facs="tcp:257:79"/> of ioy, that as ſoone as wee feele the firſt motion and tickling of it; if it be euill, we may reſtrayne it; if lawfull, we may vſe it lawfully, as a goad to prick vs to thankſgiuing, and firſt, pay the toll and tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bute of our ioy, to the Lord, in thankſgiuing, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore wee proceed further in it our ſelues; as Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chants, before they can haue the benefit of their commodities themſelues, muſt pay their Impoſt to the King.</p>
                     <p>But, alas, how oftentimes haue wee felt the Lord, euen repleniſhing our ſoules with much ioy, ſpecially of outward comforts, and yet wee, in the meane while, haue not one thought of pay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing God his toll!</p>
                     <p>Whereby it comes to paſſe oftentimes, that God being angrie with vs, for keeping backe from him his right, his Mercies are turned into Iudgements, and our ioy into heauineſſe: yea, hence it comes to paſſe, that that ioy which otherwiſe is lawfull, is now, becauſe the fruits thereof were not hallowed to God, become to vs vnlawfull and vnholy, to be checked with SALOMONS reprehenſion. <hi>Eccleſ.</hi> 2. <hi>Thou mad Foole,</hi> what doeſt thou? whither runneſt thou head-long, forgetting that GOD, in whom thou ſhouldeſt reioyce? from whoſe Mercy this thing, wherein thou art ſo delighted, did come vnto thee?</p>
                     <p>Secondly, that ioy is a ſingular and wonderfull <label type="milestone">

<pb n="148" facs="tcp:257:80"/> is much more ſo it ſelfe. If ioy make others things iuſt matters of thankſgiuing, then much more is it a matter of thankſgiuing it ſelfe. 1. <hi>Theſſal.</hi> 3. 9. <hi>What thanks can we recompenſe againe to God for you, for all the ioy wherewith we reioyce for your ſakes?</hi> And truly, ioy is the very ſoule of the ſoule, the very life of our life, without which our life is a dead, and liueleſſe life, and we our ſelues but liuing carkaſſes.</p>
                     <p>Therefore if God ſhall grant vnto vs a ioyfull and merrie heart, in the vſe of any of his mercies, let vs acknowledge it with SALOMON, <hi>Eccleſ.</hi> 2. as a ſpeciall, yea, a double bleſſing, and ſo not content our ſelues with ſingle thanks; but,</p>

                     <p>Thirdly, obſerue, what that is which muſt ſtirre <label type="milestone">

<pb n="149" facs="tcp:257:80"/> ſelues very vnfit and indiſpoſed for this dutie: wee want the ſweet ſenſe of Gods Mercy, Goodneſſe, Power, &amp;c. in thoſe benefits we haue, which ſhould enlarge and dilate our hearts with ioy: when thy heart ſhall once be poſſeſſed with this ioy, it growes ſo full preſently, that it cannot any longer containe it ſelfe within, but muſt needs powre out it ſelfe in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to thankſgiuing. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 92. 2. <hi>It is good to praiſe the Lord, to ſing to the most High;</hi> but what droue DA<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>VID hither, hee himſelfe ſhewes the reaſon in the words following: <hi>Becauſe thou cauſeſt me to reioyce in thy works:</hi> and, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 16. in the midſt of his Thankſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giuing, ſee how the heate of ioy breakes forth in him! <hi>My heart is glad, and my tongue reioyceth.</hi> Euery part of Gods worſhip hath his proper and ſpeciall affections. Now, as in Prayer, the feruency of an hungrie and thirſtie deſire is the ſpecial grace there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of; ſo in Thankſgiuing, the triumphing Spirit of ioy.

Let him ſing Pſalmes,</hi> namely, of Thankſgiuing, as appeareth by the oppoſition.</p>
                     <p>Fourthly, marke, that PAVL did not only take ioy, <label type="milestone">
                           <seg type="milestoneunit">Doct. </seg>4</label> but comfort in PHILEMONS loue; comfort preſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſeth grief; as a medicine, a diſeaſe. Therfore PAVL giues vs to vnderſtand, that PHILEMONS loue was a kind of counter-poyſon to the griefe, which his impriſonment and other afflictions wrought him. Whereby wee may learne, what is that which
<pb n="150" facs="tcp:257:81"/> will bring eaſe and comfort to the minds of Gods children in their troubles, namely, the vertue and good carriage of thoſe whom they loue and reſpect: As this will be the comfort of good Miniſters in their afflictions, if their flocks ſtand faſt in that Truth, which they haue preached. As PAVL tells the <hi>Theſſal.</hi> 1. 3, 6, 7, 8. <hi>Now are wee aliue, if yee ſtand fast in the Lord.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Thoſe then, that haue ſuch, as are neerly bound vnto them, vnder the croſſe, as People their Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters, Children their Parents, &amp;c. muſt learne here to miniſter ſound comfort vnto them in their afflic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, namely, by continuing the ſame good courſe they walked before. If they ſhrinke and goe backe, they adde to their afflictions, and euen kill their hearts. And thoſe parents which in their afflictions haue ſuch children, thoſe Miniſters that in their troubles haue ſuch people, according to PAVLS ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample, muſt comfort themſelues here withall.</p>
                     <p>Fiftly, obſerue what that is, wherefore we are to <label type="milestone">
                           <seg type="milestoneunit">Doct. </seg>5</label> take ioy in another, <hi>viz.</hi> his grace. <hi>We haue great ioy</hi> 
                        <note place="margin">Grace, argument of ioy in others.</note> 
                        <hi>in thy loue.</hi> This is that, which may iuſtly cauſe pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents to reioyce in their children, one friend and kinſman in another. 2. <hi>Iohn, We haue no greater ioy then this, that we heare thy children walke in the Truth. Phil.</hi> 2. 2. <hi>Fulfill my ioy, that yee be like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minded, &amp;c.</hi> If wee reioyce in them for other reſpects, as for Wit, Wiſedome, Knowledge, Learning, Beautie, &amp;c. our reioycing is not good, the end of our mirth wil be mourning, wee reioyce not ſo faſt now, but wee ſhall weepe and waile as faſt afterward. Withall let
<pb n="151" facs="tcp:257:81"/> vs here learne how to miniſter occaſion of ioy to thoſe that deſire to haue ioy of vs, as our Parents, Miniſters, Acquaintance, &amp;c. Let vs grow in grace, and in the true knowledge, and feare of God. O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwiſe a prophane people, giuen to Swearing, polluting the Sabbath, are thornes and pricks in the ſides of godly Miniſters, and a fooliſh ſonne is a heauineſſe to his religious parents.</p>
                     <p>The ſecond part of this Verſe followeth, name<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, the confirmation of the former part, which was, that hee had great ioy in PHILEMONS loue. This he proues, becauſe PHILEMON refreſhed the <hi>Saints bowels.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Here obſerue; Firſt, that PAVL doth not ſay, he <label type="milestone">
                           <seg type="milestoneunit">Doct. </seg>1</label> hath ioy in his loue, becauſe his owne bowels were <note place="margin">Loue to be more reioyced in, then in the profit of it</note> refreſhed by him, but becauſe the Saints bowels were refreſhed. Many will reioyce in that loue which is profitable to themſelues. But where is he that will as well reioyce in that loue which is profi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table only to others? It is plaine then, that wee re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ioyce not ſo much in loue, becauſe it is loue, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe it is a vertue, but becauſe it is beneficiall to our ſelues, and that only wee reioyce indeed in our profit that wee reape by that loue, and not in the loue it ſelfe. For if wee reioyced in the loue it ſelfe for it ſelfe, then it would be all one vnto vs, whether wee or others were benefited by it. For that loue which performeth the duties of kindneſſe to others, is as well loue, as that which ſheweth the like kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe to vs. Then therefore ſhall we ſhew our ſelues to be of S. PAVLS ſpirit, when wee can heartily re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ioyce
<pb n="152" facs="tcp:257:82"/> at the graces of Gods children, and loue them for thoſe graces, whether wee haue any profit by them or not (we ſtand not vpon that) yea, and when wee haue profit by them, wee reioyce, yet more in their profit, becauſe of the fruit that ſhall further their reckoning, then in our gaine, <hi>Phil.</hi> 4.</p>
                     <p>Secondly, marke, that then is a moſt ſeaſonable <label type="milestone">
                           <seg type="milestoneunit">Doct. </seg>2</label> time of reioycing, when we ſee the bowels of Gods <note place="margin">The fittest time of ioy, when it is well with the Church.</note> Saints refreſhed, the Church and People of God releeued in their diſtreſſes. So on the contrarie, if we ſee the bowels of the Saints wrung with griefe, and the Church pinched with the perſecution of her Aduerſaries, and that ſhee is giuen as a prey in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the hands of Wolues and Beares, hunted by many mightie NIMRODS, and furrowes are made vpon her backe by the Ploughes, then wee are to know that it is a time of mourning, and of hanging vp our Harps with the captiued Iewes vpon the Willowes. But for the moſt part, if it goe well with vs, in regard of our owne particular, wee care not greatly which way things go with the Church, ſinke ſhee, ſwimme ſhee, all is one, ſo we liue at eaſe, and ſleepe in whole skinnes. If our owne priuate eſtate be ſhaken, we take on and are much caſt downe, but teares doe ſoone waxe drie in the euils of others, though they be common to the whole body of the Saints, whereas euery mans particular depends vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the common good of the Church. And therefore as when the Church of God flouriſheth, and holds vp her head, we muſt lift vp ours, though otherwiſe it goe not ſo well with vs in our owne priuate: ſo
<pb n="153" facs="tcp:257:82"/> when the Church mourneth and hangeth down the head, wee muſt caſt downe ours, though our owne condition be neuer ſo good: for as the peace of <hi>Ieru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſalem</hi> ſweetneth our owne priuate grieuances: ſo her afflictions and dangers do ſowre and make diſtaſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full vnto vs, all priuate comforts whatſoeuer. Thus NEHEMIAH diſtaſted his fauour and honor in the Court, the Iewes in <hi>Babylon</hi> their Houſes, their Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chards, and all other their delights whatſoeuer, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 102. VRIAH his owne houſe, and wife.</p>
                     <p>Thirdly, in PHILEMONS example we are all, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording <label type="milestone">
                           <seg type="milestoneunit">Doct. </seg>3</label> to our power, taught to refreſh the bowels <note place="margin">The bowels of Gods Saints muſt be refreſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed.</note> of Gods poore diſtreſſed Saints, if we will ſhew our ſelues to haue that loue which we profeſſe. For this is the effect of PHILEMONS loue, the refreſhing of the bowels of the Saints: for there is a cold charitie and lip-loue, which is common euerywhere. That which IAMES taxeth, <hi>Chap.</hi> 2. of ſuch as will ſay to the naked, Clothe thee; to the hungrie, Feede thee; to the cold, <hi>Warme thee.</hi> But this laſt, they had need to ſay to their owne frozen charitie: for they onely ſay ſo, they doe nothing for the releeuing of thoſe neceſſities. But true loue, as it is ſeated in, and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth from the heart &amp; bowels of him that loueth: ſo it goeth downe into the very heart and bowels of him who it loueth and refreſheth them. The heart is both the place, from whence loue commeth, and whither it goeth. And then ſhall our loue iuſtifie it ſelfe to be ſincere and heartie, when, as a comfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table Cordiall, it doth our Brother good at the very heart.</p>
                     <pb n="154" facs="tcp:257:83"/>
                     <p> But wherein ſtandeth the refreſhing of the Saints Bowels? I anſwer in one word: In the performing of thoſe parts and offices of kindneſſe vnto them, which may carrie an expreſſe ſignification of our tender commiſeration and compaſſion towards them in their miſeries. If thus thou giueſt but a cup of cold water, thou ſhalt be a refreſher of the Bowels of the Saints; for nothing grieueth one in miſerie more, then to ſee himſelfe neglected of o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers. This was that which went very neere DA<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>VIDS heart in his affliction, and therefore he com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaines bitterly of it, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 69. 20. But when others ſhall pitie them, moane, and tender their caſe, and in a Chriſtian fellow-feeling, put vnder their ſhoul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, to helpe them in their weakeneſſe, therein imitating the Spirit, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8. 24. This is a great eaſe and refreſhing to their heauie and oppreſſed mindes.</p>
                     <p>Now, more ſpecially, wee are to expreſſe this our compaſſionate affection towards them, in theſe duties:</p>
                     <p>Firſt, in ſpeeches of Comfort, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 41. 1. <hi>Bleſſed</hi> 
                        <note place="margin">Three things in which we muſt refreſh the Saints.</note> 
                        <hi>is he that hath reſpect of the Poore, ſaying,</hi> (namely, vnto the poore Saints) <hi>The Lord will deliuer him in the time of trouble.</hi> Thus IOSEPH confirmed and rayſed vp the hearts of his poore-brethren, caſt downe with feare, by ſpeaking kindly vnto them, <hi>Geneſis</hi> 50. Now, theſe Conſolatorie ſpeeches, wherewithall wee are to reuiue and refreſh the ſpirits of our diſconſolate brother, are eſpecially to be taken from the ſweet promiſes of GODS
<pb n="155" facs="tcp:257:83"/> Word, which, in the beſt and wiſeſt ſort wee can, wee are to apply vnto them.</p>
                     <p>Secondly, in commending and remembring their afflicted Eſtate to GOD in our prayer. And this al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo is another thing, which the Pſalmiſt in the former place maketh another part of our reſpect towards the afflicted. In the third Verſe, after his words of Comfort, he ſetteth downe his prayer to GOD in the behalfe of the afflicted, <hi>Deliuer him not to the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire of his enemies. The Lord ſtrengthen him, lying in the Bed of Faintneſſe:</hi> For ſo TREMELIVS tranſlates it.</p>
                     <p>Thirdly, in the Workes of Liberalitie, as the need of the afflicted ſhall require, and our owne a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bilitie giue vs leaue. <hi>Phil.</hi> 4. When PAVL had re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiued the Liberalitie of the <hi>Philippians,</hi> being in priſon, he profeſſeth, that he receiued, and that now he was full. 2. <hi>Tim.</hi> 6. ONESIPHORVS miniſtring vnto him is called <hi>refreſhing</hi> of him: Where the word of Refreſhing is another word then this here vſed; a Metaphor taken from thoſe, who being al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt ouercome with heat, find ſome cooling, to ſhew, how acceptable and comfortable ONESI<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>PHORVS his reliefe was vnto him. Where yet, beſides his miniſtring vnto him, he maketh men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of his diligent ſeeking him out, and ſo viſiting him in the priſon, as another part of his refreſhing him: That we may ſee the truth of that which be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore I ſaid, That the leaſt office of kindneſſe what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoeuer, performed with a tender and pittifull heart, is a refreſhing of the Saints. But theſe three are the chiefeſt waves of refreſhing.</p>
                     <pb n="156" facs="tcp:257:84"/>
                     <p> Now, if in this ſort we are to refreſh the Saints Bowels, what ſhall we ſay then to ſuch miſerable Comforters as IOB was troubled with, that affoord ſmall or no comfort at all? True comfort is ſweet to the very Bowels. But much more are they to be condemned, who are ſo farre from comforting the Saints, and refreſhing their troubled Bowels, that they gripe and pinch their Bowels, adding to their affliction, wounding them whom the Lord hath ſmitten, as DAVID complaineth of ſome, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 69. 26. What ſhall wee ſay to ſuch as SHIMEI, that come out to gather ſtickes when the Tree is falne, and tread downe the Hedge where it is low, as he did, reuiling DAVID in that great extremitie? ſuch as the <hi>Edomites, Pſal.</hi> 138. that inſulted ouer the <hi>Iſraelites</hi> in the day of <hi>Ieruſalem,</hi> crying, <hi>Raſe it, Raſe it to the foundation thereof;</hi> that ſpeake words which are as the prickings of a Sword, to the piercing of our Bowels thorow, when rather words, as it were ſuppled with Oyle and Butter, ſhould be vſed. Surely, God will remember ſuch. DAVIDS impre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation ſhall befall them.</p>
                     <p>But let vs rather imitate PHILEMON, in refre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhing the Bowels of the Saints, knowing,</p>
                     <p>Firſt, That God himſelfe hath pronounced ſuch <note place="margin">Sixe reaſons to moue vs to the refreſhing of the Saints Bowels.</note> Bleſſed, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 41. <hi>Matth.</hi> 5.</p>
                     <p>Secondly, That herein wee imitate the Spirit of God, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8. 26. whoſe office it is, to comfort the hearts of the afflicted Saints.</p>
                     <p>Thirdly, That by the ſame meanes wee refreſh the Bowels, not onely of the afflicted, but alſo of
<pb n="157" facs="tcp:257:84"/> others, who lay to heart the afflictions of IOSEPH, as here PAVL ſayth, how he was comforted, when he heard of PHILEMON refreſhing the Bowels of other Saints.</p>
                     <p>Fourthly, Yea not onely ſo, but we ſhall refreſh the Bowels of Chriſt himſelfe. The which, as they are pricked and pierced in his Saints, <hi>Acts</hi> 9. for euen the apple of his Eye, tenderer then the Bow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>els, is hurt in them; ſo likewiſe are they refreſhed in them, <hi>Matth.</hi> 25. Therefore the Apoſtle called that Gift which the <hi>Philippians</hi> ſent him, lying in Priſon, an Odour that ſmelleth ſweet, a Sacrifice acceptable and pleaſing to God, <hi>Philip.</hi> 4. 18. So that as ſweet Odours are a refreſhing of the ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, ſo our refreſhing of the Saints Bowels, is in a manner a refreſhing of Gods owne Sences and Spirits.</p>
                     <p>Fifthly, That hereby we ſhall enlarge the ſpirit, not onely of the afflicted, but of all other good men beſides, to whom our Loue is knowne, in praying to God for vs. See an example in PAVL, praying againe and againe for ONESIPHORVS and his Family, becauſe he had beene refreſhed by him, 2. <hi>Tim.</hi> 1. 6. O happie ONESIPHORVS, that by thy Liberalitie gainedſt the ſo effectuall Prayers from ſo worthie an Apoſtle! Neuer layedſt thou out any money better then that, which returnedſt vnto thee ſo great againe, as that did which thou beſtowedſt on PAVL: For the ſeruent prayer of any iuſt man, much more of an Apoſtle, preuayleth much, <hi>Iames</hi> 5.</p>
                     <pb n="158" facs="tcp:257:85"/>
                     <p> Sixtly, That if we reape not this benefit of our Loue from men, who may proue vngratefull and vnmindfull, yet God is not vniuſt, that hee ſhould forget the labour of our Loue, which wee haue ſhewed towards his Name, miniſtring to the Saints, <hi>Heb.</hi> 6. Nay, he will cauſe it to be as Seed, that ſhal bring vs a plentifull Harueſt of many tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porall bleſſings in this life, and of eternall life it ſelfe at the reſurrection of the Iuſt.</p>
                     <p>But here it muſt not be omitted, that beſides thoſe wayes of refreſhing, ſpoken of before, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon to all ſorts, there was one way proper to PHI<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>LEMON, in regard of his Miniſterie, that which is ſpoken of, <hi>Iſai.</hi> 50. when the tongue of the Learned miniſtreth a word in due ſeaſon to the ſoule that is wearied with the burthen of ſinne. Thus muſt all Miniſters refreſh the Bowels of the Saints, as need requireth. But now adayes mens Bowels needs no ſuch refreſhing. They are rather to be pricked, as thoſe, <hi>Acts</hi> 2. with the Sword of the Law, and then they will ſtand in ſome need of Euangelicall refreſhing.</p>
                     <p>Fourthly, Here marke, what is the Condition <label type="milestone">
                           <seg type="milestoneunit">Doct. </seg>4</label> of the Saints in this life. They meete with ſuch croſſes, as doe gripe them at the very heart, and pierce thorow their very Bowels. So it was with MARY, <hi>Luk.</hi> 2. 35. And hence it comes, that their Bowels ſtand in need of refreſhing: Whereas the wicked, for the moſt part, are alwayes fat, freſh, and flouriſhing, that they need not to be refreſhed by any.</p>
                     <pb n="159" facs="tcp:257:85"/>
                     <p> But here is our comfort in this life, God will raiſe vp ſome PHILEMON, to refreſh vs; ſome SIMON, to helpe vs to beare our Croſſe; at the leaſt, he will ſend his Spirit, the Comforter, into our hearts; and at the length will bring that happie Day of refreſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, when all teares ſhall be wiped, and we ſhall need no further refreſhing. Then ſhall the wicked, with the rich man, tormented in Hell, crie for ſome re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>freſhing, as ſtanding in great need thereof, but none ſhall they get.</p>

                     <p>Now theſe things depend on the former in this manner.</p>
                     <p>In the end of the former Verſe he had ſaid, That by PHILEMON the Saints Bowels were refreſhed.

For thus PAVL reaſons here with PHILEMON: Hitherto, Brother, thou haſt beene a refreſher of the Saints bowels: Continue ſo ſtill, and refreſh now likewiſe poore ONESIMVS his bowels. But many reaſon contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riwiſe: Hitherto I haue done this or that, I thinke that well for one. I hope, now I may reſt mee a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>while, and let others take my roome, and doe as much for their part, as I haue done for mine. But the Apoſtle tells vs, we muſt not be wearie of well-doing, which they doe which would pay the debt of Obedience to God, in ſome good actions, with that which they haue paid him in ſome other for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly: wee cannot vſe a more effectuall argument to ſtirre vp men, either to godlineſſe in generall, or ſome ſpeciall actions thereof in particular, then this, which is drawne from their owne former pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice. What more forcible exhortation to conſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie in the Truth, then this? Heretofore you haue beene ſo zealous for the Goſpell, that for it you haue indured baniſhment, impriſonment, and many other afflictions, and will you now beginne to faint? Now, the ground of this argument is this, That when once wee giue ouer the courſe, which formerly wee held, wee loſe all which wee haue done before. All our former labour was vaine and bootleſſe, our Prayers, Faſtings, Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring, Preaching, Suffering, all to no purpoſe.

                     <list>

                     </list>
                     <p>For the firſt, The act of his praying is ſet forth by the <hi>Diuerſe,</hi> namely, that power which hee had of commanding. And it is, as if the Apoſtle ſhould haue ſaid: If I would vſe my power and authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie, I might command thee, but being ouercome by that great loue I beare towards thee, I willingly yeeld from that my right, and chooſe rather to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treat.

                     <p>This his power of commanding hee ſets forth: firſt, by the meaſure, <hi>Hauing great libertie,</hi> or, <hi>Though I might be very bold.</hi>

                     </p>
                     <p>Here firſt of all obſerue, that the Miniſters of <label type="milestone">
                           <seg type="milestoneunit">Doct. </seg>
                        </label> the Word haue a certayne authoritie, whereby <note place="margin">Ministers haue authoritie.</note> they may command their Hearers. 1. <hi>Tim</hi> 6. <hi>Charge them that are rich, that they be not high-minded, &amp;c.</hi> They may command with a <hi>charge,</hi> which is more then a ſimple command. So, 2. <hi>Theſſal.</hi> 3. <hi>verſ.</hi> 6. <hi>Wee command, or charge you</hi> (for the word is the ſame that before) <hi>to with-draw, &amp;c.</hi> And leſt any
<pb n="164" facs="tcp:257:88"/> ſhould ſay, that this was a peculiar priuiledge of A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtles and Euangeliſts; let him heare PAVL, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueſting all ordinarie Paſtors with the ſame autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritie. 1. <hi>Theſſal.</hi> 5. <hi>Wee beſeech you to know thoſe that be ouer you in the Lord.</hi> And, <hi>Hebr.</hi> 13. <hi>Obey thoſe that are your Guides.</hi> But that wee may the better know this authoritie, whereof wee ſpeake, the manner of it here ſet downe by the Apoſtle is to be conſidered: <hi>Hauing power to command thee in Christ.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>This authoritie then they haue to command, is not in their owne name, but in Chriſts: wherein the Ciuill and Eccleſiaſticall power are differenced. In the Ciuill power Chriſt hath Deputies and Vicars, which may command in their owne name, and by puniſhment conſtrayne men to obedience, for this power reſpects onely the outward man. But in this Spirituall power, becauſe it is ouer the conſcience, he hath no Deputie that may be fully poſſeſſed of his owne authoritie, but onely Embaſſadors. Hee calls Miniſters Stewards, who haue onely autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritie to ſignifie Chriſts pleaſure vnto vs, and can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not, as the Ciuill Magiſtrate, compell by puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</p>
                     <p>The Church therfore hath no abſolute Lordſhip in things ſpirituall. It is Chriſts alone incommu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicable to any other. Let a mans place be neuer ſo great in the Church, hee is but a ſeruant, as MOSES was, <hi>Heb.</hi> 4. hauing no Imperiall authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie in himſelfe to command, but onely in his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters Name.</p>
                     <pb n="165" facs="tcp:257:88"/>
                     <p> Firſt, Here then we ſee the Papiſts refuted, who <label type="milestone">
                           <seg type="milestoneunit">Vſe. </seg>
                        </label> challenge to the Church an abſolute and Kingly kind of Soueraignetie; not contented with that which Chriſt graunteth, which is onely Miniſteri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all. Hence it is, that they ſubſtitute the Pope in Chriſts place, and call him Chriſts Vicar. But ſure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, if euer any in the Church had beene capable of this ſo great an Authoritie, it was the Apoſtles. But beſides, that it will not ſtand with the name of an Apoſtle, that is, a Legate, or Embaſſador ſent in the name of another, the Apoſtles neuer vſed it, neuer claymed it; nay, they haue altogether diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claymed it, 2. <hi>Cor.</hi> 5. 20. <hi>Now then are we Embaſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dors for Chriſt, as though God did beſeech you through vs; wee pray you, in Chriſts ſtead, to be reconciled to God.</hi> So here, and 2. <hi>Theſſ.</hi> 3. 6. he commaunds in Chriſts Name. But if ſo be that Chriſt had as well ſet them in his owne place for ſpirituall things, as Magiſtrates for temporall, they might then haue commaunded in their owne name. Therefore all the Authoritie of Miniſters is to be confined with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in the bounds of an Embaſſage, contrarie to that which the Pope hath done, ſtiling himſelfe the Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>car of Chriſt; and ſo turning the Spirituall power, which in the Church onely is Miniſtratorie, into a meere Tyrannie and Lordſhip ouer the Faith of the Church; which yet the Apoſtle reiecteth as a thing not beſeeming him, 2. <hi>Cor.</hi> 1. in the end, <hi>Not that we haue dominion ouer your Faith,</hi> wherewithall he linketh the power of the Miniſterie, adding, <hi>But we are helpers of your ioy.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <pb n="166" facs="tcp:257:89"/>
                     <p> To whom then can that deſcription of Antichriſt, ſitting in the Temple of God, as God, better agree, then to the Pope of Rome, who blaſphemouſly ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rogateth vnto himſelfe a Power, and that abſolute, to commaund in his owne name, to bind the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience with thoſe his commaunds, to remit and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine Sinnes? But we haue ſhewed, that the power of the Church is onely the power of Seruants, Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters, and Stewards, 1. <hi>Cor.</hi> 4. 1. whereby all is done in Chriſts Name. And therefore, when Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters are ſaid to haue power to commaund, to bind, and looſe ſinnes, all theſe things are thus to be vnderſtood, That they haue power to declare Chriſts will, in his Commaundements, in his Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes, in his Threatnings. Then doth the Miniſter commaund, when hee tells vs Chriſt commaunds; remit, or retaine ſinnes, when he truly teſtifieth, that Chriſt doth ſo.</p>
                     <p>Secondly, But as this their Doctrine of the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rituall Iuriſdiction is vnſound, ſo is that likewiſe which thereupon they build: For hence they would gather the Superioritie of Eccleſiaſticall men aboue Ciuill Magiſtrates. And their Argument at the firſt may ſeeme to carrie ſome ſhew.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>He that commaundeth, is aboue him that is to be commaunded.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Miniſters commaund all Chriſtians, euen Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrates.</hi> Therefore. So Likewiſe thus: <hi>Shepheards are aboue the Sheepe.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Miniſters are Shepheards; Magiſtrates, the Sheepe.</hi> Therefore, &amp;c.</p>
                     <pb n="167" facs="tcp:257:89"/>
                     <p> But the Anſwer is eaſie, to any that ſhall conſider that which hath alreadie been ſpoken: Euery Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maunder is not greater then hee that is commaun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded; Kings ſometimes ſend meane men to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maund great Nobles. What? is a Peſant therefore aboue a Noble man? Wee muſt diſtinguiſh there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore of thoſe which commaund: ſome commaund in their owne; ſome, in anothers name. The firſt, alwayes, and ſimply, obtaine Superioritie; the lat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, onely in the cauſe of their Embaſſage. Now Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhops and Miniſters are of this laſt kind. And therefore it followes not of this, That becauſe they haue power to commaund Magiſtrates, therefore ſimply, and in themſelues, they are their Betters; that they may take the vpper hand of them in ſit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting at the Table, in going, and ſuch like actions, as it was wont to be in the Papacie; and as BELLAR<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>MINE, though very erroniouſly, would haue it both acknowledged of the Emperor MAXIMVS, and pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctiſed by Biſhop MARTIN. To whom, when the Emperour, ſayes BELLARMINE, as vnto the wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thier perſon, had ſent the Cup, brought by his ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uant to himſelfe, and he had receiued it, and drunke himſelfe, yet would not ſend it backe againe to the Emperour, but gaue it to the Prieſt, thinking none, next to himſelfe, ſo worthy as he; and that it would not haue beene ſafe for him, to haue preferred ey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the King, or any of thoſe next him, before a Prieſt. This Storie he alleageth out of SVLPITIVS writing of the life of this MARTIN, <hi>De Pontif. lib.</hi> 1. <hi>cap.</hi> 7.</p>
                     <pb n="168" facs="tcp:257:90"/>
                     <p> But firſt BELLARMINE, with his SVLPITIVS, doe cleane miſtake the matter. For this example rightly vnderſtood, doth rather ſhew the inferiori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie of Miniſters beneath the Magiſtrates. The Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perour ſent the Cup as a ſigne and token of his fauour, as it is the manner of great men to doe at the Table, as appeareth in IOSEPHS example, ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding portions from his owne Meſſe to his brethren. Now it had been no good manners for him to haue ſent backe the Cup to the Emperour, which hee had ſent as a fauour to him, to grace him. But ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit, BELLARMINE could bring many ſuch Exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples of Clergie men, preferred in ſuch things be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore Magiſtrates, and that this example would ſerue his turne for this purpoſe, yet the Doctrine we haue gathered out of this place, ouerthroweth them as vnlawfull: for the ſuperioritie of the Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſter is onely in his Embaſſage, whileſt for the time hee is Gods mouth to vs. But when they are at Dinner, or at Supper, they are out of their Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baſſage then. And being out of their Embaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſage, they are inferiour, not onely to Kings, but alſo to their Seruants, inferiour Magiſtrates, 1. <hi>Pet.</hi> 2. 13, 14.</p>
                     <p>Againe, it may be anſwered, That the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maunder is aboue the commaunded; but the Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter properly doth not commaund, but God by the Miniſter; and ſo Princes are ſubiect, not to the Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters, but to Gods owne Authoritie, whereof the Miniſters are onely diſpenſers. And thus vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand that, <hi>Eſai.</hi> 60. 10.</p>
                     <pb n="169" facs="tcp:257:90"/>
                     <p> Away then with the pride of ambitious DIO<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>TREPHESSES, that euen in Ciuill Things would haue Preeminence aboue the Ciuill Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſtrate.</p>
                     <p>Thirdly, But wee muſt take heed, leſt whileſt wee find fault with the Papiſt, for giuing too much, wee our ſelues, in the meane time, giue not too little. This is the propertie of fooles, to runne from one extreme to another. Therefore PAVL, after that hee had refuted, in the three former Chapters of the firſt Epiſtle to the Corinthians, thoſe that went too farre in magnifying of Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters, in the beginning of the fourth, leſt he ſhould ſeeme to be Author to any, of derogating from the Miniſterie, he addeth, <hi>Let a man yet ſo thinke of vs, as of the Miniſters of Chriſt, and diſpenſers of the Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crets of God.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>It can ſcarce be expreſſed in words, with what diſdaine Miniſters are contemned, not onely of the great Ones, but euen of the vulgar ſort. Euery baſe companion will in reproch call them Parſons and Prieſts. Why! what are you, but a Prieſt? As if one ſhould ſay to the Kings houſehold-ſeruant, You are but the Kings ſeruant. I, but doe you make but a but of it? Is not this a place of good account? Is the Steward of a Kings Family no body, becauſe he is ouer the Family not as a Lord, but as a Steward? Is the Miniſter no body, becauſe he commaunds not in his owne name, but in Chriſts? But is it not counted a matter of greater honour, to be ſent in Embaſſage by an earthly Prince.</p>
                     <pb n="170" facs="tcp:257:91"/>
                     <p> The authoritie of Miniſters, as I haue ſhewed, is only the authoritie of Meſſengers, and Embaſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dours, and laſts only during the time of their meſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſage, and embaſſage. What then, when they haue done their meſſage, are they ſo lightly to be regar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded? <hi>God forbid.</hi> Nay, according to the Apoſtle, for their works ſake, they are to be had in ſingular account alwayes, and euerywhere, and not onely whileſt they are in their worke, being a preaching in the Pulpit.</p>
                     <p>But when they are in their embaſſage, declaring the Will of Chriſt, then ſpeciall reuerence and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard is to be giuen them, then according to COR<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>NELIVS example are wee to ſet our ſelues before them, as before God himſelfe: for they command in Chriſts Name, and therefore their contempt is contumelious to Chriſt himſelfe, in whoſe Name they ſpeake, <hi>Matth.</hi> 10. Miniſters therefore muſt be heard with ſubmiſſiue and obedient minds; for if they haue authoritie to command vs in Chriſt, how can any whoſoeuer denie obedience? Nay, Kings themſelues are to be obedient to them, that are o<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>uer them in the Lord, as the Apoſtle willeth, for it is Chriſts authoritie, and not the Miniſters, and therefore it equally bindeth the King and the Beg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger. But, alas, Miniſters may command, euen meane perſons: but who obeyes their commands? They may command, and doe themſelues. Their words are accounted only, as a blaſt of wind.</p>
                     <p>This authoritie of commanding, as it is ſet forth by the manner <hi>in Christ,</hi> ſo by the meaſure, hauing
<pb n="171" facs="tcp:257:91"/> 
                        <hi>great authoritie, &amp;c.</hi> For, being in Chriſt, it muſt needs be great.</p>
                     <p>This muſt teach Miniſters to ſpeake with great boldneſſe, when they know they are armed and bac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked with Chriſts authoritie. Indeed if thoſe things wee ſpeake, were in our owne names, wee had iuſt cauſe to be afraid, becauſe oftentimes our meſſage is very vnwelcome to carnall eares, but ſpeaking in Chriſts Name, we may, as the Apoſtle here ſaith, be <hi>very bold,</hi> lifting vp our voices as Trumpets, <hi>Eſai.</hi> 58. 1. knowing that God hath giuen vs the Spirit, not <hi>of feare, but of power and loue, and of a ſound mind,</hi> 2. <hi>Tim.</hi> 1. 7. The meaneſt Sergeant, that is in the Kings name, dares arreſt the greateſt Duke that is. In this houſe, the baſeſt Skullion in that kitchin, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſet on by your Honours, would not be afraid to controule the Steward. But take heed, thou that art a Miniſter, leſt at any time thou preſume to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand, to rebuke, or threaten in thy owne name. Chriſt will not beare thee out in ſuch commands, neither will he make good ſuch threatnings. If men in ſuch a caſe offer violence, looke not that hee ſhould reſcue thee, but in his owne cauſe he will be a wall of braſſe vnto thee, <hi>Ier.</hi> 4. Wherefore, as a faithfull Embaſſadour, reueale the whole Counſell of God, let neither feare, nor the golden ſquincey, nor any thing elſe ſtop thy mouth. Thou haſt Chriſt to be thy Authour, in that thou art to ſay. Aſſuredly, he will neuer goe backe from that, which hee hath willed thee to ſpeake. ABSALOM encou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raged his ſeruants, to ſlay his brother AMNON, by
<pb n="172" facs="tcp:257:92"/> this argument: <hi>Haue not I commanded you?</hi> 2. <hi>Sam.</hi> 13. How much more ſhould the Commandement of Chriſt put heart and ſpirit into the Miniſters, to o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen their mouthes, and to ſpeake freely, and fully, and frankly, whatſoeuer they haue in Commiſſion?</p>
                     <p>Thirdly, S. PAVL ſets forth his authoritie of commanding, by the matter of it. What is it that he may command? any thing what hee pleaſe? No. Though hee were an Apoſtle, yet hee hath no ſuch infinite authoritie. What then? <hi>That which is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenient.</hi> See then the bounds of this ſpirituall pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er. It can command nothing, but <hi>that which is conuenient.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>And this neceſſarily followeth out of the former, for it is in Chriſt. And Chriſt can command no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing which is not conuenient; wherefore, if Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters at any time ſhall command things inconueni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent, they doe now exceed their bounds, they goe beyond their Commiſſion, neither doe they now command in Chriſts Name, but in their owne. And therefore in ſuch caſes wee are ſo farre from being bound to obedience, that wee are in conſcience to diſobey. This ouerthroweth the tyrannicall and vſurped Dictatorſhip of the Pope, who maketh his owne will a Law, and thinketh, hee may doe in the Church what him liſteth.</p>
                     <p>The proprietie of the word, <hi>Conuenient,</hi> is alſo to be obſerued. It ſignifieth that which in equitie we are bound vnto, though not in the rigour of the Law. If PHILEMON ſhould ſtand vpon it, hee was not to receiue ONESIMVS againe, but in Chriſtian equitie he was.</p>
                     <pb n="173" facs="tcp:257:92"/>
                     <p> Note then, that wee are bound not onely to doe <label type="milestone">

                        </label> thoſe things, which the very extremitie of Law will draw from vs, but alſo ſuch whereunto reaſon and equitie doe perſwade. Thus much of the firſt illu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtration of the act of praying from the <hi>diuerſe,</hi> his power of commanding: <hi>Though I haue great, &amp;c.</hi>
                     </p>

                     </p>
                     <p>The cauſe that made PAVL deale by intreatie, when hee might haue commanded, was loue, not PHILEMONS loue towards the Saints, that hee ſpoke of in the ſeuenth Verſe, as ſome would haue it, but his owne loue towards PHILEMON.</p>
                     <p>Obſerue firſt, in the example of the Apoſtle, that <label type="milestone">
                           <seg type="milestoneunit">Doct. </seg>

So the Miniſters may thinke they haue done ſome great matter, if by any meanes, euen by earneſt and affectionall perſwaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and exhortation, they can get at our hands this debt of obedience wee owe to God. And no mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uell if Miniſters thus deale, when God himſelfe herein goes before vs in his owne example. <hi>Oh that Iſrael would haue harkned, Pſal.</hi> 81. 13. and <hi>Matth.</hi> 23.
<pb n="174" facs="tcp:257:93"/> Chriſt ſhewes that hee inuited the Iſraelites in the ſame manner vnto himſelfe, that the Hen doth her Chickens. Wherein we haue great cauſe to admire the vnſpeakable goodneſſe of God towards vs. Men commonly are earneſt and importunate In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treaters for thoſe things which may be profitable to themſelues, but who is earneſt in deſiring ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, to doe that which is only for the profit of him, with whom he dealeth, and not any whit profitable to himſelfe. If a man of himſelfe cannot ſee what is for his owne good, and of his owne accord doe it not without further adoe, we count him worthy to ſmart for his folly. But here, God dealing with vs by his Miniſters, ſo pathetically to turne, and recon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cile our ſelues vnto him, the profit is ſolely our owne: wee only ſhall haue the commoditie of this reconciliation, and not God, who could as ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ently glorifie himſelfe in our euerlaſting confuſion. Our hearts therefore muſt relent, and be ouercome by this kindneſſe of God, ſo ſweetly, and gently calling and alluring vs vnto himſelfe.</p>
                     <p>Obſerue further, in PAVLS example, that ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times <label type="milestone">

It is a weake argument. This is lawfull in it ſelfe, therefore it is lawfull for me. In it ſelfe it was lawfull to eate of things ſacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficed to Idols, and yet in the caſe of ſcandall, the Apoſtle forbids the <hi>Corinthians</hi> to eate of them, 1. <hi>Cor.</hi> 8.</p>
                     <p>It is lawfull in it ſelfe for a Miniſter to receiue
<pb n="175" facs="tcp:257:93"/> maintenance from his flocke; but it was not lawfull for PAVL, preaching at <hi>Corinth,</hi> 1. <hi>Cor.</hi> 9. <hi>For then he had abuſed his libertie,</hi> Verſ. 18. <hi>And hindred the Goſpell, Verſ.</hi> 12. and ſo conſequently ſinned. The caſe is alike in the vſe of our Chriſtian libertie, in things indifferent, as meate, drinke, apparell, ſport, recreation. It is a point of Chriſtian wiſedome to conſider, not only what is lawfull, but alſo what is expedient and profitable, not only what is lawfull in generall, but alſo in ſpeciall, what is lawfull for mee and thee; for if the vſe of our libertie be a ſtum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bling blocke, at which our Brethren may fall and hurt themſelues, we muſt then bridle and reſtrayne it. Here then is condemned the tenacitie and teme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritie of ſome in the vſe of that libertie, which the Word hath graunted them in things indifferent. Their tenacitie, that they hold their owne ſtifly, and will not let goe the leaſt part of their right, though the glorie of God, and good of their Brethren doe earneſtly craue and begge it at their hands. Their temeritie, not onely that they themſelues ruſh ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turouſly vpon all things that in themſelues are law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full, not conſidering with themſelues, whether in regard of ſome circumſtances, it may not be vnlaw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full for them, what inconuenience may enſue, what hurt may alſo ariſe to the Goſpell, but alſo cenſure and condemne others, who kept backe by Chriſtian wiſedome and charitie, dare not runne with them to the ſame exceſſiue vſe of their libertie. Let them remember that PAVL, in this place, hauing much libertie of commanding, yet choſe rather to intreat.</p>

If Gods glorie and the Churches good be deare vnto vs, wee will not vſe our libertie to the full, in thoſe things which may hinder and hurt both. If therefore thou wouldeſt obtayne ſo much of thy ſelfe, as to remit and giue in ſomthing of thy right to God and thy Brethren; firſt, it is neceſſary that thy heart be inflamed with a zealous affection both towards Gods glorie, and the Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches good. This conuinceth many of ſmall loue to their Brethren, that will not moderate their liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie, no not in thoſe things which they ſee neceſſari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly will bring in the ruine of the Church.</p>
                     <p>The Papiſts alſo are here confuted, who would make this departing from our right, for Gods glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie and the Churches good, to be a worke of ſuper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erogation: For this is their iudgement of PAVLS preaching <hi>gratis,</hi> and diuers ſuch like examples in the Scriptures. If the works of Charitie be aboue the Law, then alſo are theſe works to the which the Law of Charitie bindeth vs aboue the Law, for it is loue which makes vs yeeld.

                     <p>Thus much for the firſt ſpeciall illuſtration of the Propoſition of this Petition, namely, of his <hi>act of praying.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <pb n="177" facs="tcp:257:94"/>
                     <p> The ſecond followeth, namely, of the <hi>perſon praying:</hi> PAVL himſelfe: <hi>I pray thee,</hi> deſcribed firſt by his age, <hi>being as I am,</hi> PAVL <hi>aged;</hi> ſecondly, from his impriſonment, which he maketh a greater matter then his age, <hi>and now alſo a priſoner of Ieſus Christ;</hi> both theſe are here brought in, to adde fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther weight to his petition, and to ſtirre vp the affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions of PHILEMON.</p>
                     <p>Firſt, That he vrgeth his yeeres, as a matter that <label type="milestone">
                           <seg type="milestoneunit">Doct. </seg>1</label> ſhould make PHILEMON more reſpect this his <note place="margin">Reuerence due to age.</note> ſuit, we learne, that ſpeciall reuerence is due to this age. God vnder the Law prouided for this, that there ſhould be more then ordinarie regard had of the aged, but ſpecially in the Miniſterie; for after they began to be in yeeres, he would haue them ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed of the burthen of their Miniſterie, and yet dou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble honour to be giuen to them, both of reuerence and of maintenance. Now, if the white head and ſiluer haires of a Miniſter, ſuing for another, ſhould procure authoritie vnto him in his ſuit, and mooues the affections of thoſe he ſues vnto, how much more then, ſuing for himſelfe? And queſtionleſſe, there cannot be a ſpectacle of greater compaſſion, then an aged Miniſter, gray-headed, in the Seruice of God and the Church, being in diſtreſſe. <hi>Age</hi> (ſayes SALO<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>MON) <hi>is a Crowne of Glory, being found in the way of righteouſneſſe.</hi> If in any way of righteouſneſſe, much more in the way of the Miniſterie, righteouſly and faithfully diſcharged.</p>
                     <p>Such then that are like PAVL in the Miniſterie, or in any other Calling, that haue ſpent their time pain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully
<pb n="178" facs="tcp:257:95"/> and profitably, may with honeſtie vrge their age, pleading for themſelues and others. But the old man, that hath liued vainly and vnprofitably all his youth, and hath alwayes beene a burden of the Earth, is an vncomely ſight. For old age is an ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour in it ſelfe yea, a part of Gods Image, who is the <hi>Ancient of Dayes. And honour</hi> (ſayes SALOMON) <hi>be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comes not a foole.</hi> To ſuch old men, their honour is turned into ſhame; Their gray haires are rather aſhes of ſhame and humiliation, then a Crowne of glory.</p>
                     <p>Secondly, Vrging his impriſonment, as another <label type="milestone">
                           <seg type="milestoneunit">Doct. </seg>2</label> matter, and that of greater weight then the former, <note place="margin">Miniſters to be regarded the more for their afflictions.</note> wherefore he ſhould be reſpected in this fuit, he teacheth vs, that the afflictions of Gods Miniſters are ſo farre from being any iuſt cauſe to make vs leſſe to reuerence them, that for them they are more reſpectiuely to be vſed, and honourably to be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiued of. Many Miniſters enioying peace and li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bertie, and flouriſhing in the Pulpit, haue beene much flocked after, and greatly regarded, as IOHN BAPTIST; but when once they haue beene clapt vp in Priſon, then they haue beene ſhamefully neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lected, as it ſeemeth IOHN was by many of his hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rers, whom our Sauiour vpbraideth with this, <hi>That they reioyced only in him for a ſeaſon;</hi> namely, whileſt he enioyed his Miniſterie peaceably. And this their forgetting of him in the Priſon, is not improbably thought by ſome to be the cauſe that made Chriſt breake forth into ſo large commendations of IOHN being then in the Priſon.</p>
                     <pb n="179" facs="tcp:257:95"/>
                     <p> The third ſpeciall illuſtration followeth; name<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, of the laſt part of the Propoſition of the Petiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, which is <hi>the partie ſued</hi> for, <hi>viz.</hi> ONESIMVS: for it is a matter of great moment, in ſuing for any, that the partie we ſue for, be ſuch a one, that he may ſufficiently commend himſelfe, euen without our commendation. Now here PAVL ſheweth, that ONESIMVS was ſuch a one; entituling him his Sonne: Withall, he noteth the circumſtance of the place where he begot him, <hi>in the Priſon.</hi> The name of Sonne is Metaphoricall, and implyeth onely thus much, That by PAVLS Miniſterie, ONESIMVS was conuerted to the Faith.</p>
                     <p>Firſt, Here I obſerue, That the Miniſters are mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued <label type="milestone">
                           <seg type="milestoneunit">Doct. </seg>1</label> with a ſpeciall kind of affection, equalling, if <note place="margin">Affection of Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters to their Conuerts.</note> not ſurpaſſing, the naturall affection of Parents to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards thoſe whom they haue gayned to Chriſt. Therefore PAVL here calleth ONESIMVS, whom hee had conuerted, his Sonne, and afterwards, his Bowels. And ſo <hi>Eſay</hi> 8. <hi>Behold I and my children, whom thou haſt giuen me.</hi> Wee muſt loue all Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans, but yet more ſpecially, thoſe that are of our owne begetting, the workmanſhip in ſome ſort, of our owne hands. As men naturally loue all little children, but yet their owne in a higher degree. For it is true which the Philoſophers once ſaid, Euery man loues his owne Worke: as we ſee in Poets, lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing their owne Poeſie, hatched in their owne braines; and Artificers, louing their owne inuenti<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ons. And hence it muſt needes follow, that the af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection of the Apoſtles towards the Church, as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="180" facs="tcp:257:96"/> the Fathers and Founders thereof, muſt needes exceed the affections of ordinarie Paſtors that ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed, building vpon their foundations, 1. <hi>Cor.</hi> 4. 15. S. PAVL challengeth the name of <hi>Father</hi> of the <hi>Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rinthians,</hi> as proper to himſelfe, and calleth thoſe that ſucceed in that Church, but Schoolemaſters. Now, the affection of a Father farre exceedeth the affection of a Schoolemaſter to the child. Now, if Miniſters carrie this fatherly affection to them whom they haue conuerted, then it behooueth thoſe whom they haue conuerted, to carrie the duti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full diſpoſition of louing and obedient ſonnes to them, aboue any other Miniſters. If we owe much to naturall Parents, the inſtrument of this Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porall, how much then to our Spirituall, the inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of our eternall life? Neuer can we come out of their debt.</p>
                     <p>Secondly, Obſerue, what Miniſters may truly be <label type="milestone">
                           <seg type="milestoneunit">Doct. </seg>2</label> called the Fathers of the Church. Surely, they <note place="margin">What Miniſters are the true Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers of the Church.</note> which haue begotten children vnto God, and with <hi>Eſay,</hi> can preſent themſelues before the Lord with the goodly traine of their Spirituall progenie. This name belongeth firſt of all, and principally, to the Apoſtles, who layed the firſt foundation of the Church: as wee ſhewed a little before, how PAVL claymed this name in ſpeciall ſort, in regard of the <hi>Corinths;</hi> becauſe, howſoeuer other ordinarie Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtors that ſucceeded him, begat, no doubt, ſome par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular perſons, yet hee begat the whole Church. They then haue a ſpeciall intereſt in this name, that begat whole Churches at once, thouſands at one clap, as PETER, <hi>Acts</hi> 2.</p>
                     <pb n="181" facs="tcp:257:96"/>
                     <p> Now this which is ſpoken of the Apoſtles, that gaue the firſt conſtitution to the Church of the New Teſtament, is true alſo of others, ſage men, of extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinarie and Apoſtolicall ſpirit, as LVTHER, CAL<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>VIN, and many others, who gaue a reſtitution to the Church, falne in theſe latter dayes. They alſo more ſpecially may be called the Fathers of the Church. Secondly, this name alſo belongeth to or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinarie Paſtors; and amongſt them, more eſpecially to ſuch that encreaſe the Church, eſtabliſhed with new off-ſpring: For although they are farre more noble and excellent Fathers, that are Fathers of the whole Church, then they who onely are Fathers of ſome few particular members of a Church; yet theſe latter alſo are Fathers: for it is not the multitude of ſonnes, but a ſonne, that makes a Father. And PAVL here calling ONESIMVS his ſonne, makes himſelfe a Father, as well in regard of him, as of the whole Church of the <hi>Corinthians.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>The Pope then and Popiſh Prelates are vnwor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thie of the honour of this name, with all idle and ſlouthfull Miniſters, ſeruing onely their owne bel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lies. Rather may they be called Betrayers of the Church, then Fathers thereof, who eyther conuert not at all, or els peruert and make their Conuerts, as the Phariſes in our Sauiours time, ſeuen times more the children of the Deuill, then they were be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore. But yet among the Paſtors of the Church, not onely thoſe whoſe Miniſterie God honoureth with the conuerſion of Soules, are to be honoured alſo with this name of Fathers, and none elſe: <hi>Honour</hi>
                        <pb n="182" facs="tcp:257:97"/> 
                        <hi>thy Father and Mother,</hi> ſayes the fifth Commaunde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; where God honoureth our Superiors with the name of Parents, and ſo in the Commaunde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment does that himſelfe which he biddeth vs doe. Now all true and lawfull Miniſters, ſet ouer vs by the Lord, are our Superiors; and yet how many ſuch are there, whoſe Miniſterie, though it be very faithfull, yet is nothing fruitfull in the gaining of Soules? Theſe, though they haue no Spirituall po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteritie, <note place="margin">How Miniſters that conuert not, are called Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers.</note> yet in the fifth Commaundement are called Fathers. And ſo well may they be called, for theſe two reſpects:</p>
                     <p>Firſt, Becauſe they doe their beſt endeuour to be Fathers; they caſt forth continually the Spirituall Seed of the Goſpell, and ſow it in the furrowes of our hearts. Indeed, it is not ſufficient for the get<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting of the name of a naturall Father, to doe thy endeuour, vnleſſe the euent anſwer thy endeuour, becauſe the fault may be in the Seed; vnfit it may be for generation: but here the Spirituall Seed of the Goſpell is incorruptible, ſubiect to no fault; and therefore the blame of the Miniſters ſterilitie cannot be imputed to themſelues, faithfully doing their beſt endeuour.</p>
                     <p>Secondly, Becauſe they carrie the affections of Fathers towards their people; ſuch as PAVL deſcri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beth, 2. <hi>Cor.</hi> 6. 11, 12. And in this reſpect, S. IOHN in his generall Epiſtle calleth all the members of the Church, his Children, though not all begotten by his Miniſterie. This fatherly affection they ſhew principally in theſe points:</p>
                     <pb n="183" facs="tcp:257:97"/>
                     <p> Firſt, In ſeeking not the Churches, but the <note place="margin">Foure things, in which the father<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly affection of Miniſters ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peares.</note> Church it ſelfe, 2. <hi>Cor.</hi> 12. 14. and that with ſo ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſt a deſire, that they preferre the good of the Church before their owne liues, as PAVL ſheweth in the ſame place; for this is the affection of natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall Fathers, as we ſee in the example of DAVID to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards ABSALOM, that they can be content to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deeme their childrens liues with their owne. Hire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lings therefore, that make this the only end of their Miniſterie, that they may warme themſelues with the fleece of their Sheepe, ſetting the Church at ſale for their owne lucres ſake, are not in any wiſe to be called Fathers of the Church. Are Children thus dealt withall by their Parents? The true Fathers of the Church preferre the good thereof before their owne liues; theſe men, their owne priuate commo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditie, before the very life of the Church it ſelfe.</p>
                     <p>Secondly, Parents nouriſh their children at their owne Table; and that they may be able ſo to doe, they are content to take any paines whatſoeuer. So muſt and doe Miniſters that are faithfull, prouide Spirituall nouriſhment for the Church: And for this purpoſe are alwayes and plentifully furniſhed with ſtore, both old and new, which they may bring forth for the benefit of the Church, as need ſhall require. Therefore idle and ignorant Miniſters, killing the people with the Famine of the Word, are iuſtly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priued of the honour of this name. <hi>Parents lay vp for their children,</hi> 2. <hi>Cor.</hi> 12. ſayth the Apoſtle. Theſe men lay vp no Spirituall Treaſures for the Church; therefore the Church cannot acknowledge them as their Fathers.</p>
                     <pb n="184" facs="tcp:257:98"/>
                     <p> Thirdly, They reſemble Fathers, in that they doe not only giue their people Spirituall food, but with a fatherly and motherly affection, 1. <hi>Theſſ.</hi> 2. 10. <hi>As you know how we exhorted and comforted euery one of you, euen as a father his child.</hi> It is not ynough to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hort, to admoniſh, to teach, and inſtruct, but all this muſt be done with the affection of the Father; ſo that we may giue them their Spirituall ſuſtenance, as Nurſes doe little children their bodily. This is that, in his owne example, the Apoſtle commendeth vnto vs, 1. <hi>Theſſ.</hi> 2. 7, 8. <hi>We were gentle among you, euen as a Nurſe cheriſheth her children. Thus being affectioned towards you, our good will was to haue dealt vnto you, not onely the Goſpell of God, but alſo our owne ſoules, becauſe ye were deare vnto vs.</hi> This phraſe of dealing his owne Soule, ſignifieth that effectuall affection wherewithall he deliuered the Word vnto them, as <hi>Eſa.</hi> 58. God commaunds to giue Almes to the Poore with feeling and compaſſion, vſeth the ſame phraſe, <hi>Thou ſhalt powre out thy ſelfe to the hungry.</hi> So <hi>Phil.</hi> 1. 5. <hi>God is our witneſſe, how we long after you from the very heart root.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Fourthly, They reſemble naturall Fathers in this, that as there, ſo here likewiſe, Loue deſcends, rather then aſcends. The naturall Parent cannot blot out naturall affection, no, not towards vntow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ard and rebellious children, as wee ſee in DAVIDS mourning for ABSALOMS death. <hi>Can a Mother forget the fruit of her Wombe,</hi> ſayes the Prophet? <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſay</hi> 49. No, certainely ſhe cannot, though the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>generating child ſhould forget her.</p>
                     <pb n="185" facs="tcp:257:98"/>
                     <p> Here then doe good Miniſters ſhew themſelues true Fathers, when yet they continue to loue them that are wicked and vnthankfull, yea, iniurious to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards them. Thus it was with PAVL, 2. <hi>Cor.</hi> 13. 15. <hi>We will willingly be beſtowed for their Soules, though the more we loue you, the leſſe we be loued of you.</hi> Now the ground of this ſo ſtrange and ſtrong affection, in the former verſe he made to be this, that he was to them a Father, and they to him in ſtead of Children.</p>
                     <p>If Miniſters are thus Fathers, and muſt thus be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haue <label type="milestone">
                           <seg type="milestoneunit">Vſe. </seg>
                        </label> themſelues to their people, as to ſonnes, then it becommeth them to put vpon them the diſpoſition of ſonnes, and to carry themſelues to their Miniſters as towards their Fathers. If then Miniſters be Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, where is the filiall reuerence of their Flockes? Where is the reciprocation of like affection? Where is the imitation of the Storke, nouriſhing his old Damme? 2. <hi>Cor.</hi> 6. 3. After the Apoſtle had moſt liuely deciphered, and as it were in an anatomie lay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed open and naked his fatherly bowels, inferreth forthwith thus, <hi>I ſpeake vnto you of like recompence as vnto children, Be ye alſo enlarged.</hi> Idolatrous MI<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>CAH ſhall iuſtly condemne many of vs, who enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining that rouing Leuite into his houſe, promiſed vnto him the honour of a Father, <hi>Iudg.</hi> 17. <hi>Thou ſhalt be</hi> (ſaid he) <hi>vnto me as a Father.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Thirdly, obſerue, in that PAVL ſaith he begat, that <label type="milestone">
                           <seg type="milestoneunit">Doct. </seg>3</label> is, conuerted ONESIMVS, that the Scripture vſeth ſometimes to giue that to the Inſtrument of God, which properly belongeth to the Lord God him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe: for the Apoſtle ſpeaking of our Regeneration,
<pb n="186" facs="tcp:257:99"/> calleth vs Gods owne Creatures, his Workman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip, <hi>Eph.</hi> 2. 10. Therefore we are not, in regard of our Conuerſion, the Creatures of any Miniſter: yet becauſe God doth it not without the Miniſterie of his Seruants, therefore this bleſſed worke is often<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times giuen to them alſo. This PAVL telleth TI<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>MOTHY, <hi>He ſhall ſaue thoſe that heare him.</hi> And all Miniſters of the Goſpell are called <hi>Sauiours, Obadiah</hi> the laſt; and yet properly, Chriſt is our Sauiour.</p>
                     <p>This may ſerue to checke the Papiſts, vrging a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt vs theſe places of Scripture, which ſeeme to aſcribe ſome vertue to the Sacraments; as, <hi>Titus</hi> 3. <hi>He ſaued vs by the waſhing of the new Birth.</hi> 1. <hi>Pet.</hi> 3. <hi>Baptiſme ſaueth.</hi> If they can vnderſtand, how TI<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>MOTHIES preaching may ſaue the hearers, after the ſame manner let them know, that Sacraments doe conferre grace, not as in themſelues, not by the worke wrought, but becauſe without them God or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinarily vſeth not to worke.</p>
                     <p>Fourthly, Note the Dignitie of the Miniſterie, <label type="milestone">
                           <seg type="milestoneunit">Doct. </seg>4</label> 
                        <hi>Whom I haue begot.</hi> Properly, God onely is the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther <note place="margin">The dignitie of the Miniſterie.</note> of Spirits, <hi>Heb.</hi> 12. <hi>Call no man Father; yee haue but one Father, that is, in Heauen, Matth.</hi> 23. And yet we ſee in ſome ſort, how God taketh the Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters into the Societie of the ſame Honor with him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe. Naturall Parents count it a bleſſing, to haue faire and well-fauoured children; but the Sunne neuer ſaw ſo goodly and ſo glorious a Creature, as is this new Creature in Chriſt, the workmanſhip of the Miniſterie. If then vnto naturall Parents, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing ſtore of children, that of the Pſalmiſt may truly
<pb n="187" facs="tcp:257:99"/> be ſaid, <hi>Bleſsed is the man that hath his Quiuers full of ſuch Arrowes;</hi> certainely, much more fitly may it be applyed to thoſe Spirituall Fathers: for naturall children oftentimes proue thoſe fooles SALOMON ſpeakes of, <hi>that are a ſhame and diſcredit to their Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents;</hi> and that euen in the Gate, opening the mouthes of the aduerſaries to triumph and inſult. But theſe Spirituall children cannot proue ſuch fooles; therefore they cannot diſgrace their Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents, but doe offer iuſt matter vnto them of ſtop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping the mouth of their aduerſaries. For this did that famous Father of our reſtored Church, IOHN CALVIN, of bleſſed memorie, anſwer the Papiſts, vpbraiding him with his want of children in mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage: <hi>Oh</hi> (ſaid he) <hi>God hath, in ſtead of ſuch children, giuen me many thouſands of farre more excellent kind of children through the whole world.</hi> Since then God hath vouchſafed ſo great an honour to the Miniſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie, that he will vſe their helpe in this Spirituall Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neration; goe to then, let vs that are Miniſters, la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour that we may attaine to this ſo high an honour, accounting this barrenneſſe no leſſe reproch and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buke, then once the Iewes did that other.</p>
                     <p>O then, thou vnfaithfull and negligent ſeruant, when others ſhall bring into the Lords Barne a plentifull Harueſt of the Seed of the Goſpel, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with they were betruſted, what ſhall become of thee, who through thy negligence and ill husbandry haſt ſuffered that ſo precious a Seed to rot vnder the Cloddes? With what face wilt thou come alone into the preſence of Chriſt, and his holy Angels, at
<pb n="188" facs="tcp:257:100"/> the laſt day with others, being attended with the Honorable Trayne of their thouſands, and hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreds, as the Apoſtles and others (O ſweet and godly ſight!) ſhall appeare before him, and ſay, O Lord, here we are, and not we alone, but theſe our children with vs, whom wee hauing begotten and gayned vnto thee formerly, doe now preſent be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore thee.</p>
                     <p>Then ſhalt thou, as vnſauourie ſalt, be caſt out on the dunghill, when theſe that haue made many wiſe, ſhall ſhine as the Starres in the firmament, <hi>Dan.</hi> 12. Neither yet ſerueth this for admonition to the Miniſters alone, but alſo to the People, by whoſe fault it commeth to paſſe, and that very of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten, that the Miniſters want the full honour of this name. For though wee ſtriue neuer ſo much with you to conuert you, yet ſuch is your peruerſneſſe that yee will not yeeld. Though as PAVL with the <hi>Galathians,</hi> we trauaile as women in childbirth with you, <hi>till Chriſt be formed in you,</hi> yet in many of you, that is true, which is ſpoken of EPHRAIM, <hi>Hoſea</hi> 13 13. <hi>Hee is an vnwiſe ſonne, elſe would he not ſtand ſo long a time in the place of the breaking forth of the children.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Fiftly, obſerue likewiſe the neceſſitie of the Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters <label type="milestone">
                           <seg type="milestoneunit">Doct. </seg>5</label> of the Goſpell: for by their meanes and mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſterie <note place="margin">The neceſſitie of the Ministerie.</note> God refineth our ſoules, hee frameth and faſhioneth vs anew. Contemne not then the Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſterie as a thing ſuperfluous, vnleſſe thou loue thine owne deſtruction. If thou wouldeſt haue the Church to be thy Mother, thou muſt haue the Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters
<pb n="189" facs="tcp:257:100"/> of this Church, in ſome ſort likewiſe her Huſbands, to be thy Father.</p>
                     <p>Sixtly, here ſome may ſay: if PAVL beget ONE<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>SIMVS, <label type="milestone">
                           <seg type="milestoneunit">Doct. </seg>6</label> and ſo other Paſtors haue their ſpirituall <label type="milestone">
                           <seg type="milestoneunit">Obiect. </seg>
                        </label> ſonnes; how then could the <hi>Corinthians</hi> be iuſtly blamed, for calling themſelues by the names of their Miniſters? for children are to be called by the name of their Parents.</p>
                     <p>Miniſters are improperly called Fathers: for as <label type="milestone">
                           <seg type="milestoneunit">Anſw. </seg>
                        </label> we haue alreadie noted, properly God onely is the Father of Spirits. And therefore from CHRIST our Father, the worke of whoſe Spirit we are called <hi>Christians,</hi> and not from PAVL, <hi>Paulians;</hi> from CE<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>PHAS, <hi>Cephists;</hi> who are only Chriſts inſtruments: therefore CHRYSOSTOME interprets that place, 1. <hi>Cor.</hi> 1. 12. <hi>I am</hi> PAVLS, <hi>and I am</hi> APOLLOS, <hi>I am</hi> CHRISTS, that the laſt words ſhould be the Apoſtles owne, croſſing the <hi>Corinthians,</hi> and ſhew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing them in his owne example, who they muſt be called by. Wherefore, Miniſters beget children; as vnder the Law, the Brother that rayſed vp ſeed to his elder Brother, deceaſed without iſſue, the ſeed was called by the name of his deceaſed Brother, and not his owne.</p>
                     <p>Seuenthly, the Metaphor of begetting, ſheweth <label type="milestone">
                           <seg type="milestoneunit">Doct. </seg>7</label> that our conuerſion is a new kind of Generation, as <note place="margin">Conuerſion, a new Generation.</note> our Sauiour ſhewes plainly, <hi>Ioh.</hi> 3. Therefore, no man euer got ſanctification out of his Mothers wombe: No man ſucks it out of his Mothers breſts. That thou mayeſt be truely ſanctified, thou muſt haue another birth beſides thy firſt. Hence it is cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led,
<pb n="190" facs="tcp:257:101"/> A new creation. If then thou haſt nothing but thy pure naturals, nothing but that which thou broughteſt with thee out of thy Mothers belly in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the world, aſſure thy ſelfe thou art not as yet con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerted. And yet it is ſtrange to ſee how men doe flatter themſelues, in regard of their naturall gifts, yea, oftentimes of their naturall birth, being deſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cended of honorable or worſhipfull Parents. But if that firſt birth would ſerue, what needed there ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther? Certainly, euen the Royall bloud it ſelfe is ſtayned and taynted with originall ſinne. And it is the water of Regeneration only that will waſh out this ſtayne. Thy naturall birth may entitle thee to a temporall and earthly Kingdome. Only the ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall birth can giue thee right to the Kingdome of heauen, <hi>Ioh.</hi> 3. 1. <hi>Pet.</hi> 1. 3, 4.</p>
                     <p>Eightly, this ſame Metaphor teacheth vs alſo, <label type="milestone">
                           <seg type="milestoneunit">Doct. </seg>8</label> that we are meere Patients in our conuerſion, euen <note place="margin">We are patients in our conuer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion.</note> as the Infant is in his generation, hee receiueth his being from his Parents, but hee himſelfe doth no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing for the making of himſelfe. Wherefore the diſpoſition of our wil &amp; works preparatorie to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerſion, are here refuted. If the Infant can diſpoſe himſelfe to his owne generation, then alſo may wee prepare our ſelues for our owne regeneration; or if the world at the beginning, before it had yet any being, could diſpoſe it ſelfe to the worke of her creation, then may we alſo to the worke of our re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creation in Chriſt The BAPTIST foretelling the calling of the Gentiles, ſets it forth by this notable Metaphor, <hi>God is able out of theſe ſtones to raiſe vp</hi>
                        <pb n="191" facs="tcp:257:101"/> 
                        <hi>children vnto</hi> ABRAHAM. If ſtones, void of all life, can diſpoſe themſelues to the receiuing of life; then may we alſo, very ſtones, in regard of any Spirituall life, dead in our ſinnes, haue ſome diſpoſition in our ſelues to our conuerſion.</p>
                     <p>Ninthly, Further, this Metaphor of Generation <label type="milestone">
                           <seg type="milestoneunit">Doct. </seg>9</label> notably ſetteth forth the order of our Conuerſion. <note place="margin">The order of our conuerſion.</note> The Infant is not perfited at once in his Mothers Wombe, but by degrees, piece by piece; firſt, his braine, heart, and liuer, then the nerues, veines, and bones are framed, then, in the laſt place, comes fleſh, and ſo he hath his perfect conſtitution. No man is ſuddenly, in one moment, an abſolute Chriſtian, as ADAM was made at the firſt daſh an entire com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plete man; but our Conuerſion proceedeth on by degrees; firſt, we haue ſome imperfect rudiments of Faith; ſome good motions, but thoſe as yet confu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed; ſome good deſires, but thoſe very faint ones, not much vnlike to ſmoaking Flaxe: But afterwards, the skilful finger of the Holy Ghoſt poliſhing vs, and as the Beares doe their mis-ſhapen birth, by licking of them, more acurately refining vs; then the indige<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſted and confuſed Chaos of our faith is brought into a more comely order, then the ſmoake begins to breake forth into an open flame. The Infant in the Mothers Wombe firſt liueth, as ARISTOTLE will haue it, the life of a Plant, then, of a ſenſitiue Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, and then laſt of all, of a Man. The ſame won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derfull Progreſſe, the ſame diuine Artifice, yea, farre greater is there in the faſhioning of this Spirituall Infant in the Wombe of the Church, then there is of
<pb n="192" facs="tcp:257:102"/> that other, in the Wombe of his naturall Mother. And therefore, conſidering the courſe and order of our regeneration, we may wel tranſlate thoſe words of DAVIDS, concerning the framing of our naturall bodies, from that worke, to the worke of our new birth, and cry out, <hi>Fearefully and wonderfully am I made,</hi> namely, a new creature in Ieſus Chriſt. This muſt teach vs, not to deſpiſe the weake ones as no Chriſtians, for they are Chriſtians in making, though not as yet throughly made. The Infant is no leſſe a man, then he of growne yeeres; and with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all, let vs remember, that wee had our time of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ception, before we were borne and brought forth.</p>
                     <p>Tenthly, In PAVLS example, ſetting forth him <label type="milestone">
                           <seg type="milestoneunit">Doct. </seg>10</label> whom hee commendeth, with the title of a Sonne, one conuerted by his Miniſterie, learne, that wee are not indifferently to commend all and euery one, but onely Sonnes, not Baſtards.</p>
                     <p>Eleuenthly, And when wee doe commend ſuch <label type="milestone">
                           <seg type="milestoneunit">Doct. </seg>11</label> as are worthie our commendations, learne then in PAVLS example, how wee are to commend them, not coldly, not ceremonially and formally; he that asketh faintly and fearefully, teacheth to denie; but paſſionately, and with affection, as here PAVL re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peating the ſame words of entreatie againe, <hi>I beſeech thee, I beſeech thee for my ſonne</hi> ONESIMVS. So then onely commend the worthie, and commend them worthily, or not at all.</p>
                     <p>Twelfthly, If PAVL with ſuch contention and <label type="milestone">
                           <seg type="milestoneunit">Doct. </seg>12</label> earneſtneſſe doth here plead the cauſe of one poore ſeruant; with what heat of affections, and enlarge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
<pb n="193" facs="tcp:257:102"/> of Spirit, is to be thought he would haue dealt for a whole Church, ſtanding in like need of his helpe. Wherefore, if at any time we ſhall haue occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion to deale with any in the behalfe of a whole Church, let this importunitie of PAVL in ONESI<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>MVS his cauſe, ſhake out of vs that our maidenly modeſtie, and arowſe and quicken our ſpirits. For if we ſhal deale more remiſſely in the publike cauſe of the Church, then PAVL dealt in the priuate cauſe of a poore ſlaue, ſurely wee may ſeeme rather diſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blers and preuaricators, then petitioners.</p>
                     <p>In the end of the Verſe, the circumſtance of the place where he begat ONESIMVS, is noted, <hi>in my bonds.</hi> And this circumſtance addeth weight to the reaſon: for by calling him <hi>Sonne,</hi> hee ſufficiently ſhewed, that hee was deare vnto him; but adding, that he <hi>begat him in his bonds,</hi> he doth not obſcurely intimate, that he was the beſt beloued of his ſonnes, dearer vnto him then the reſt: For neither doe natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall Parents loue all their children equally; their af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection vſeth to be greater to thoſe whom they haue in their old age, as IAACOBS was towards IOSEPH; becauſe a good thing, the leſſe hope wee haue of it, the more gratefull it is when we haue it. And in old age, Parents haue leſſe hope of children then before. So alſo had PAVL leſſe hope of Spirituall children in the Priſon, then when he had liberty of preaching the Goſpell freely where he liſted. ONESIMVS then was PAVLS Darling, as being then begot of him, when by the Aduerſaries hee was caſt into Priſon, that he might beget no more.</p>
                     <pb n="194" facs="tcp:257:103"/>
                     <p> Firſt then obſerue, That Miniſters may loue their <label type="milestone">
                           <seg type="milestoneunit">Doct. </seg>1</label> ſonnes with an vnequall loue; they may loue ſome, more then others, as Chriſt did IOHN aboue the reſt of the Diſciples; namely, thoſe in whom they be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold a more liuely image of Chriſt, and in the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>getting of whom, they had greater experience of Gods power and mercie, then in others.</p>
                     <p>Secondly, Note, That the Spirit of God and the <label type="milestone">
                           <seg type="milestoneunit">Doct. </seg>2</label> Word of God is not bound together with the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies <note place="margin">The Spirit and Word are not bound.</note> of the Miniſters, for both theſe, namely, the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit and Word of God, were now effectuall in the Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon for ONESIMVS his conuerſion. The Aduerſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries then muſt not thinke, that the reſtraining of the Miniſters, and of the Goſpell, will proue one worke. The Earle of <hi>Derbies</hi> Accuſation in the Parliament Houſe againſt M. BRADFORD, was, That he did more hurt (ſo he ſpake, calling good, euill) by Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters and Conferences in Priſon, then euer hee did when he was abroad, by Preaching.</p>
                     <p>Thirdly, Note, PAVL ſaying, that he begot him in <label type="milestone">
                           <seg type="milestoneunit">Doct. </seg>3</label> his Bonds, hence it is eaſie to gather, that after, by ſpeech had to and fro with him in the Priſon, he vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtood in what caſe he was, he preſently wrought vpon him, to bring him to a ſight of his ſinne, and ſo to a godly ſorrow for it. By which example, Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters muſt learne, that it is their dutie, not onely in their publike meetings to ſeeke mens conuerſion by their generall preaching to all; but if at any time, by Gods prouidence, they ſhall light vpon any, whom they ſee miſerably to ſtray out of the wayes of God, though it be in priuat places and companies, as here
<pb n="195" facs="tcp:257:103"/> PAVL vpon ONESIMVS in the Priſon, and PHILIP vpon the Eunuch, in iourneying; they are by all meanes poſſible, no iuſt cauſe detaining them, to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deuour the conuerſion euen of ſuch, and to doe the part of a good Samaritane towards them, whom they find ſo dangerouſly wounded by Sathan. For what? muſt we helpe the Aſſe, euen of our enemie, couching vnder his burthen, and ſhall we not much more relieue his ſoule? for we are not to thinke, that God is ſo tyed to publike meetings, that he cannot elſewhere, ſpecially in times of Perſecution, vſe the Miniſterie of his Seruant, for the effectuall calling of his Elect: although I doubt not, but ONESIMVS heard PAVL more ſolemnly preaching in the priſon. See <hi>Acts</hi> 28. in the end.</p>
                     <p>Fourthly, But as all Miniſters are greedily to catch <label type="milestone">
                           <seg type="milestoneunit">Doct. </seg>4</label> thoſe occaſions which God offers for furthering the ſaluation of their brethren; ſo eſpecially thoſe, who being impriſoned, are reſtrained from their publike Preaching, that ſo by this meanes the want of their publike Sermons may in ſome meaſure be ſupplied. Now how goodly a thing it is for Miniſters, euen then when they are pooreſt, to make others rich, 2. <hi>Cor.</hi> 6. 10. and when they are bound and captiue, to make others free! as here PAVL beſtoweth a farre more excellent freedome vpon ONESIMVS, then that whereof NEROES Priſon had depriued him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe.</p>
                     <p>Fifthly, See how God mitigateth the bitterneſſe <label type="milestone">
                           <seg type="milestoneunit">Doct. </seg>5</label> of our afflictions, by mixing the ſweetneſſe of ſome <note place="margin">God ſweetens the afflictions of his children.</note> comfort therewithall, euen as the Phyſicion ſugreth
<pb n="196" facs="tcp:257:104"/> his bitter pilles. This is the reſpect God hath of our weakeneſſe. PAVLS impriſonment could not chuſe out be grieuous to the fleſh; but this griefe was leſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſened, when he ſaw himſelfe bound, to be the inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of vnbinding ONESIMVS, chayned with a farre ſtronger chayne, then that which hee was bound withall, for the hope of <hi>Iſraels</hi> ſake. This al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo was a great comfort to IOSEPH, being ſold, that he found ſuch extraordinarie fauor with his Maſter; and when he was in the Priſon, hee was ſo ſpecially reſpected by the Maſter of the Priſon. Thus God in Anger remembers Mercy, and wee muſt remember this his Remembrance to our ſelues, thereby to qui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>et and ſtill our lamenting mindes. Euen as other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>whiles alſo he remembreth Anger in his Mercy: for God wil both ſawce his Bleſſings with ſome Croſſe, that wee ſhould not be too much lifted vp, and hee will ſweeten our Croſſes with ſome Comforts, that wee ſhould not be too much caſt downe.</p>

<pb n="197" facs="tcp:257:104"/> it with ſtrong and perſwaſiue arguments. Now here firſt of all he preuents an Obiection; yet ſo, that withall he doth bring a very effectuall reaſon for the ſtrengthening of his Petition.</p>
                     <p>The Obiection may more fully thus be framed, What is this that I heare? Doeſt thou entreat me for that vile Varlet ONESIMVS? that vile Varlet and fugitiue Theefe? Wilt thou open thy mouth for ſuch a one? PAVL anſwers by a diſtinction of times, <hi>Once, now,</hi> graunting, that once he was ſo, but now the caſe is altered with him, hee is become a new man.</p>
                     <p>In his anſwer note two things: firſt, his graunt of the Obiection, in regard of time paſt, wherewithall he mollifies the Obiection with a leſſening kind of ſpeech, when he ſayth only, that he was <hi>vnprofitable;</hi> although he was not onely vnprofitable, but alſo hurtfull: ſecondly, the denyall of it in regard of the time preſent, which is ſet forth by the contrarie Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmation, <hi>Now</hi> (he ſaith not he is not vnprofitable, but) <hi>he is profitable.</hi> And this his profitableneſſe is amplified by compariſon of vnequals, that it is farre greater then his former vnprofitableneſſe; which is ſhewed by the ſubiects of both: Before he was vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>profitable to thee only, but now his profitableneſſe extends it ſelfe, not only to thee, whom only he hurt with his theft, but to me alſo, and ſo in me, to many others.</p>

And in that PAVL, as ſoone as euer he had named ONESIMVS, forthwith preuented this Obiection, thereby hee giues vs ſufficiently to vnderſtand, That ſuch is our corruption, that we can ſcarce patiently endure the very names of thoſe that haue wronged vs. And tru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, wee ſhall ſee oftentimes, at the very naming of thoſe whom they count their enemies, their bloud will preſently riſe. But as PAVL went about to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uent this in PHILEMON, ſo muſt wee in our ſelues; and for this purpoſe, wee muſt call backe our minds from thoſe iniuries which our brethren haue done vs, and ſet them to conſider of thoſe which we very indignely haue offered the Lord. And when we ſhal once ſee his patience, in bearing with great and grie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uous contumelies at our hands, this will make vs more eaſily to paſſe the ſmall and pettie iniuries of our brethren.

                     <p>Whence wee may learne, that ſometimes there may be wicked ſeruants euen in the families of moſt religious Gouernours. ONESIMVS, when hee was yet a Naughty-pack, was yet in godly PHILEMONS houſe. Thus was ELISHA troubled with GEHAZI, and ABRAHAM with HAGAR. Neither alwaies may the wickedneſſe of the ſeruants be imputed to their Maſters, ſo that they doe that which belongeth to them, as, no doubt, PHILEMON did aboundantly, for his houſe was the Church of God. But if any ſuch
<pb n="199" facs="tcp:257:105"/> naughtie ſeruants grow deſperate, and ſeeme to vs paſt recouerie, then they muſt be caſt forth, as once HAGAR was with ISMAEL. And it is to be thought, that ONESIMVS continuing ſo as he did, if he had not runne away himſelfe, would quickly haue been put away by his Maſter.</p>
                     <p>The ſecond part of PAVLS anſwer, is his denying of that which is obiected, in regard of the time pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent, <hi>but now profitable.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Here firſt marke the vnlikeneſſe of ONESIMVS <label type="milestone">

                        </label> to himſelfe, in regard of diuers times. <hi>Once,</hi> that is, <note place="margin">True conuerſion workes a mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſt change.</note> before his conuerſion, he was vnprofitable, <hi>but now,</hi> after his conuerſion, he is become <hi>profitable.</hi> Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, true conuerſion hath manifeſtly ioyned with it a change and alteration; inſomuch, as when I com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pare a mans life preſent with his life paſt, I may breake forth into an admiration, and ſay, O how much he is changed from that he was wont to be! See 1. <hi>Cor.</hi> 6. 11. <hi>Rom.</hi> 6. and <hi>Eph.</hi> 5. <hi>Ye were once Dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, now ye are Light.</hi> This then is no ſmall or ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcure change, which is like that change which is made in the aire by the riſing of the Sunne; nay, it is ſuch a change, that not onely the inward affections of the mind doe put on a new nature, but alſo the outward carriage of life, a new face and habite, and that euen in the iudgement of thoſe which before were our companions in wickedneſſe, <hi>Who thinke it ſtrange</hi> we hold not on our former courſe, 1. <hi>Pet.</hi> 4. 4. Here then is a notable note, to try our conuerſion by; Looke, if there be difference of our affections and actions paſt and preſent, felt of our ſelues, and
<pb n="200" facs="tcp:257:106"/> diſcerned of others. How many are there, that are the ſame that they were alwayes, euen from the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning? and this they thinke a ſpeciall commenda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. Others indeed are changed, but with a change cleane contrarie to this of ONESIMVS, from good to euill, and from euill to worſe: of whom it may be ſaid, <hi>Once profitable, but now vnprofitable;</hi> once Preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, now perſecuters of the Faith. But if any will be in Chriſt, let him become a new creature, let all old things paſſe away, and let all things become new.</p>
                     <p>Secondly, In that PAVL ſtoppeth PHILEMONS mouth, readie to take vantage againſt ONESIMVS for his former wicked life, with his preſent courſe of life now conuerted, we learne, that the ſinnes which went before our conuerſion, muſt nothing preiudice vs, hauing repented. For true repentance wipes and waſhes away all the ſtaine of them, euen out of the ſight of God; much more ſhould it do ſo out of the ſight of men. Shall man be more ſeuere then God, who is Iuſtice it ſelfe? Shall we condemne thoſe that God hath iuſtified? Shal we lay open that nakednes which God hath couered? Shall we rake vp thoſe dead carkaſſes which God hath buried; and that in the graue of his owne Sonne? Farre be it then from vs, to vpbraid any of the Saints, either with their ſinnes before their conuerſion, or with thoſe their faults and falls after conuerſion, the blot whereof they haue taken away by their renued repentance. Nay, farre be it from vs, to ſhew our ſelues any thing more ſeuere to a true Penitentiarie for his former ſinnes. We are not to hit men in the teeth with that
<pb n="201" facs="tcp:257:106"/> baſe eſtate wherein once they were, after it pleaſeth God to aduance them to higher callings, <hi>Galat.</hi> 2. 6. much leſſe then are we to vpbraid thoſe whom God hath lifted vp to the <hi>high calling</hi> of Chriſtianitie, ſarre exceeding all the Callings of this life whatſoeuer, with that ſeruile condition they were vnder before, to Sinne and Sathan. And yet this is the common practice of many, inſomuch, that the prouerb is true, <hi>Once I did ill, &amp;c.</hi> But herewithall PAVL imparts thus much, that vnleſſe ONESIMVS had repented, there had beene place for this exception. If then, hauing ſinned and defiled thy Conſcience, thou goeſt on impudently, and carrying a whooriſh wainſcot for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>head, that cannot bluſh, and art not any thing trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled or touched in Conſcience for it, then know, the ſtaine of thy ſinne ſtill remaines, &amp; makes thee igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minious; God &amp; thine owne Conſcience, yea Sathan and the world may caſt the dung of it in thy face, and fill thee with reproch: till thou haſt baptized thine owne Conſcience with the teares of repentance, the filth of thy ſinne ſtill ſticks in it, euen as dirt doth in the face, till it be waſhed. Though the very act of do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the ſinne paſſe away haply in a moment, yet im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penitencie is a kind of continuation thereof. Hence Chriſt ſaith, <hi>Ioh.</hi> 19. 41. to the obſtinate Phariſes, <hi>that their ſinne remained,</hi> continued, &amp; ſtood firme and ſet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led: <hi>&amp;</hi> 10. 8. <hi>All that were before me, are theeues,</hi> though they were dead: yet he ſaith not, <hi>They were,</hi> but in the preſent tenſe, <hi>They are theeues and robbers,</hi> becauſe in the impenitent, ſinne cleaueth to them no leſſe after the committing of the ſinne, then if ſtill they were in the very act of doing of it.</p>
                     <pb n="202" facs="tcp:257:107"/>
                     <p> But to repentant ſinners this miniſtreth ſingular comfort, ſpecially then, when by the clamors of Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>than, their own conſcience, and the inſulting world, they ſhall be conſtrained, with IOB, to poſſeſſe euen the ſinnes of their youth. To all theſe, ſetting vpon vs at once, we muſt anſwer as here PAVL did for O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>NESIMVS, oppoſing the ſweet diuine Sentence of ſweet and holy BRADFORD, <hi>Tell me not, Sathan, what I haue beene, but what I am and will be.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>This profitableneſſe of ONESIMVS, as I touched before, is made greater then his former vnprofita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bleneſſe, in regard of the perſons whom it reſpect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth, which are two, firſt, his Maſter, <hi>to thee,</hi> ſecondly, PAVL, <hi>to me.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>For the firſt, it may be asked, how could ONESI<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>MVS <label type="milestone">
                           <seg type="milestoneunit">Queſt. </seg>
                        </label> as yet be profitable to his maſter, before he was returned; as yet, he had done him no ſeruice?</p>
                     <p>It is likely, that whileſt ONESIMVS was with <label type="milestone">
                           <seg type="milestoneunit">Anſ. </seg>
                        </label> PAVL, he did him the beſt ſeruice he could; wherein he was but his Maſters deputy, as appeareth by that which PAVL ſayth, <hi>Verſe</hi> 13. But I take the ſimple meaning of PAVL to be, That hee was now, by his conuerſion, made ſuch a one that might be profita<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ble to him, though as yet actually he were not.</p>
                     <p>Hence then we learne, who be the profitable ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uants, <label type="milestone">
                           <seg type="milestoneunit">Doct. </seg>
                        </label> namely, the religious. For PAVL here grants <note place="margin">Religious ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uants profitable.</note> that ONESIMVS, whileſt he was prophane, was alſo vnprofitable to his Maſter; but being now conuer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, he ſaies, that he is profitable. This I would haue Maſters conſider, in the choice of their ſeruants. Commonly, all that is ſtood vpon here, is skill and
<pb n="203" facs="tcp:257:107"/> abilitie for thoſe ſeruices wee purpoſe to employ them in; as it is ſaid of SALOMON, that he ſaw IERO<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>BOAM was a man fit for the worke. But as for Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion, no great matter is made of that, which yet is all in all: for I auouch it, that the vngodly ſeruant, though otherwiſe he may ſeeme neuer ſo fit for our turnes, to be vnprofitable; and that a ſeruant fearing God, though comming farre ſhort of the other, in wit, knowledge, and dexteritie, for managing of bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſineſſes, ought yet to be preferred before him, as farre more profitable. For firſt, the euill ſeruant draweth the Curſe of God vpon all his endeuours; whereby it commeth to paſſe, that euen the wiſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome of ſuch as are not inferior to ACHITOPHEL, often vaniſhes into fooliſhneſſe. And whereas the contrarie, by vertue of Gods bleſſing proſpering whatſoeuer the righteous man takes in hand, <hi>Pſ.</hi> 1. 3. euen his fooliſhneſſe &amp; ſimplicitie, in reſpect of the deepe policies of the wicked man, is turned into wiſedome, and ſorteth to very good &amp; happy effect, <hi>Pſ.</hi> 37. <hi>The little of the iuſt man is more then great riches of the wicked.</hi> That which is ſpoken there of wealth, is true likewiſe of wit, and of the inward gifts of the mind, as well of the outward goods of this life. A little wit, skill, &amp; knowledge in a godly ſeruant, ſhall goe further, and be more ſeruiceable to his Maſter, then twice as much in an euill ſeruant. When IO<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>SEPH managed POTIPHARS buſineſſes, and IAA<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>COB, LABANS, all things were well. If then godly ſeruants, by vertue of Gods bleſſing vpon their la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours, be profitable to vngodly men, how much
<pb n="204" facs="tcp:257:108"/> more then to godly? If the impietie of the Maſters whom they ſerue, cannot with-hold Gods bleſſing from their labors, how much more ſhall the pietie of their Maſters, concurring with their owne, draw downe the bleſſing of God? But as the Maſters wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kedneſſe hurteth not the godly ſeruant, faithfully walking in his calling, ſo neither doth his godlineſſe any thing profit the labours of the wicked ſeruant, whom hee wittingly and willingly hath choſen, though wicked. Therefore here PAVL confeſſeth, that ONESIMVS, whileſt he was a wicked ſeruant, was vnprofitable to PHILEMON, though a godly Maſter. Againe, the wicked ſeruant doth not onely bring the Curſe of God vpon himſelfe and his ende<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uours, but vpon others that liue and conuerſe with him, as by the example of ACHAN endangering the whole Army, and IONAS the whole Ship, may ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciently appeare. Contrariwiſe, for the ſakes of godly ſeruants, others in the Family haue fared the better: neither are vngodly ſeruants vnprofitable onely to the body, but to the ſoule alſo, infecting the whole Family with the contagion of their euill example, euen as one ſcabbed ſheepe will doe a whole flocke. On the contrarie, by their good example, adorning the Goſpel of Chriſt, and cauſing it to appeare beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifull in the eyes euen of their irreligious Maſters, they doe oftentimes gaine them to the loue and li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king thereof, <hi>Tit.</hi> 2. 10. 1. <hi>Pet.</hi> 2. 10, 11, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> to the 15. Verſe, euen as the beleeuing wife doth the vnbelee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing husband, 1. <hi>Cor.</hi> 7. Laſtly, the religious ſeruant wil ſurely be faithfull and truſtie to his Maſter, as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="205" facs="tcp:257:108"/> tyed vnto him by a ſure bond; that Conſcience which he maketh of obeying Gods Co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mandement, that inioineth him obedience to his maſter, not with eye-ſeruice, but in ſimplicitie of heart. Now for irre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligious ſeruants, howſoeuer ſome ſometimes proue faithfull, yet we cannot ſafely truſt them, as not ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing the like ſure hold of them: for how ſhouldeſt thou looke he ſhould be faithfull to thee, that is vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faithfull to God? whom Conſcience reſtrayneth not from vnfaithfulneſſe, but either want of occaſion, as we ſay in the prouerb, makes a thiefe, or feare of pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment, or hope of gaine, or ſome ſuch like reaſon. But that fidelity which is built only on ſuch founda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, will eaſily be ſhaken &amp; ouercome: whereas the fidelity of the godly ſeruant hauing a farre ſurer and ſafer foundation, namely, his faithfulneſſe to God, is not ſubiect to the like ficklenes. Such a ſeruant ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, that ſerues his heauenly Maſter, in ſeruing his earthly, mayſt thou betruſt with any thing: as we ſee ABRAHAM did commit that weightie buſineſſe of prouiding a wife for his ſonne, to his godly ſeruant<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> whom withall he betruſted with a great part of his ſubſtance, which he had in his hands, going that iour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney about ISAAKS marriage. I truſt now, that it is ſufficiently manifeſted, That onely the religious ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uant is the profitable ſeruant, howſoeuer the world, blinded in iudgement, iudge him, of all others, the moſt vnprofitable. Wherfore, as this muſt teach Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters, as we haue ſhewed, to haue a ſpeciall reſpect of Religion in the election of their ſeruants, ſo likewiſe ſeruants, if ſo be that they deſire to do any profitable
<pb n="206" facs="tcp:257:109"/> ſeruice to their Maſters; firſt of all, truly to conuert to the Lord, their heauenly Maſter, to ſubiect them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues to him, and for his ſake to ſerue their earthly, and then they ſhal be right ONESIMVSSES indeed, and of <hi>vnprofitable</hi> ſeruants become <hi>profitable.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>But here Maſters alſo muſt learne another Leſſon, That ſince their godly ſeruants are profitable to them, they likewiſe be in ſome good meaſure profi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table alſo to their ſeruants, and doe not deale with them in any caſe ſo as LABAN would haue done with IACOB, ſend them away emptie, when they haue for many yeeres had the benefit of their ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uice, and thereby haue been made partakers of ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny of Gods bleſſings. Maſters muſt not be vnprofi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table to their profitable ſeruants.</p>
                     <p>Further, we may obſerue out of this, that S. PAVL <note place="margin">Conuerſion worke conſcience in particular Cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lings.</note> maketh ONESIMVS, now conuerted, a profitable ſeruant; that the fruits of true conuerſion doe not only appeare in the generall duties of Chriſtianitie, but alſo, and that ſpecially, in the ſpeciall duties of our perſonall Callings. Many profeſſe, heare, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue, pray, and doe ſuch like generall duties, who yet in the works of their ſpeciall Callings are found halting ſo groſſely, that they may ſeeme wholly to denie the power of Godlineſſe. For they make no conſcience, if they be Children, or Seruants, to ſhake off the yoke of their Parents and Maſters; if Tradeſ-men, to deale deceitfully and vnfaith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully. But if thou be truly conuerted, whatſoeuer thy Calling ſhall be, in it ſpecially thou wilt ſhew the power of Religion. If a Seruant, thou wilt be
<pb n="207" facs="tcp:257:109"/> a Religious and dutifull Seruant; if a Maſter, a iuſt and equall Maſter, one that will haue a care of thy houſholds ſoules, as well as their bodies, &amp;c. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, <hi>Luk.</hi> 3. when IOHNS hearers came to know what were thoſe fruits of Repentance hee would haue them to bring forth, euery one had the works of their ſpeciall callings enioyned them: The Pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licanes giuen to oppreſſion and extortion, <hi>To aske no more then their due;</hi> the Souldiers giuen to Ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pine and Violence, <hi>To doe no man wrong, to be content with their wages, &amp;c.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>The ſecond perſon to whom ONESIMVS is <hi>pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fitable,</hi> is PAVL himſelfe: <hi>and to me.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Here then we ſee, that the profitableneſſe of O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>NESIMVS being now conuerted, doth exceed his former vnprofitableneſſe: That hee may ſeeme to deſerue more loue now, then hee did hatred before. And thus it is with all thoſe that are truely conuer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, the good they doe then, exceedeth the euill they did before. If they haue hurt any, they doe very abundantly make vp that harme, not only be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing profitable to thoſe whom they haue hurt, but alſo to others whom they neuer harmed. As here ONESIMVS by his theft ſpecially hurt PHILEMON, but being now conuerted, hee was not onely profi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table to his Maſter, whom he had hurt, but to PAVL and many others, whom hee neuer hurt. So PAVL himſelfe in his perſecution hurt onely the Churches in <hi>Iudea,</hi> and neere adioyning: but by his Preaching and Writing hee did good to the whole Church throughout the whole world, not onely whileſt he
<pb n="208" facs="tcp:257:110"/> liued, but euen by his Writings, being dead. Art thou then conuerted? Recount &amp; recognize thy life paſt; remember what hurt thou haſt done by thy euill example, and labour to doe not only as much, but farre more good, by giuing of good example. If thou haſt exceeded others in ſinne, thou muſt like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe exceed them in obedience. The worſe we were before our calling, the better muſt we be afterward. This was that which made PAVL goe beyond the reſt of the Apoſtles in pains and zeale in preaching, becauſe he was beyond them all in malice before. This made MARY MAGDALENE ſo exceſſiue in her loue to Chriſt aboue others, becauſe ſhe had beene as exceſſiue and immoderate before in the loue of her vnlawfull pleaſures.</p>
                     <p>But here it may be asked, How was ONESIMVS <label type="milestone">
                           <seg type="milestoneunit">Queſt. </seg>
                        </label> profitable to PAVL?</p>
                     <p>Many wayes. Firſt, in that he reioyced him by <label type="milestone">
                           <seg type="milestoneunit">Anſ. </seg>
                        </label> his Conuerſion. The heauenly Quire of Angels ſang ioyfully at his Conuerſion, <hi>Luk.</hi> 15. Much more then might PAVL, who was the author of his Conuerſion, and ſo the founder of the Angels ioy. Secondly, he miniſtred to him, queſtionleſſe, whileſt he ſtayed with him, and he was now made fit to mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſter vnto him, <hi>Verſe</hi> 13. Thirdly, ONESIMVS ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing receiued the gift of ſpirituall ſpeech, was able thereby to edifie and comfort PAVL, euen as the poore <hi>Romans</hi> were, <hi>Rom.</hi> 1. 12.</p>
                     <p>Here then we ſee, that a Chriſtian man is not one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly profitable to them that hee is bound to by his ſpeciall calling, but alſo to others further off from
<pb n="209" facs="tcp:257:110"/> him; and that which may ſeeme ſtrange, though he be the leaſt of the faithfull, he may be profitable to the greateſt. Wherefore the ſtrong and tall Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans muſt not contemptuouſly caſt off the weake and little ones. The head to the foot cannot ſay, I haue no need of thee, thou canſt doe me no good. PAVL, the chiefe of the Apoſtles, here affirmeth O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>NESIMVS, of the baſeſt ſort of ſeruants, to be profi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table vnto him.</p>
                     <p>Wherein we haue further in PAVL an example of <label type="milestone">
                           <seg type="milestoneunit">Doct. </seg>
                        </label> true humilitie, ſo ingenuouſly acknowledging that profit which he reaped by ſo meane a perſon. But now we may find many ONESIMVSSES, that will ſcarce acknowledge that profit which they haue receiued from PAVLS. But it is the part of a good nature, to acknowledge thoſe whom God hath v<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed as meanes and inſtruments of any good vnto vs, though they be neuer ſo meane in this world. Otherwiſe, wee are vngratefull and iniurious, not onely to the inſtrument, but to God himſelfe.</p>
                     <p>Laſtly obſerue, That vnto true Conuerſion, it is <label type="milestone">
                           <seg type="milestoneunit">Doct. </seg>
                        </label> not ynough that we abſtaine from euill; but alſo, that we doe the contrarie, good. For PAVL here ſhewing the fruits of ONESIMVS his Conuerſion, doth not onely denie, that he is vnprofitable now, as before, but affirmeth the contrarie, and ſayth, that he is become profitable. See then in ONESI<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>MVS the practice of the Apoſtles Precept, <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 4. <hi>Let him that ſtole, ſteale no more, but let him rather worke with his hands that which is good.</hi> ONESIMVS had hurt his Maſter before by his theft; but now
<pb n="210" facs="tcp:257:111"/> being conuerted, hee doth not onely giue ouer his ſtealing, but begins faithfully to attend his Vocati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and therein to be profitable to his Maſter. It is not ſufficient for vs to ſay, we lead harmeleſſe liues; nay, <hi>Euery Tree that bringeth not forth good fruit, ſhall be hewne downe;</hi> and not thoſe only, that bring forth euill fruit. Neyther ſhall Chriſt accuſe the wicked at the laſt day, for taking the Meat out of his Mouth, or plucking his Apparrell off his Backe, but for not putting Meat into his Mouth, and Clothes vpon his Backe.</p>

But let vs ſee wherein the force of this Argument conſiſts; in two things ſpecially.</p>
                     <pb n="211" facs="tcp:257:111"/>
                     <p> Firſt, in this, that he ſent ONESIMVS, and that ONESIMVS came not of himſelfe; <hi>Whom I haue ſent:</hi> that the force of the Argument ſhould be in the word, <hi>I.</hi> As if he ſhould ſay, If ONESIMVS of himſelfe had come vnto thee, ſubmitting him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe, Chriſtian compaſſion would haue taught thee to haue reſpected; much more then now, comming in my name, and with my Letters. So that wee are not eaſily to reiect thoſe that come graced and countenanced vnto vs with the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendations of godly and reuerent Miniſters.</p>
                     <p>Secondly, in that hee did not onely ſend his Letters to PHILEMON, keeping ONESIMVS with him at <hi>Rome,</hi> till he had receiued an Anſwer from him, and ſo know whether he were willing to reaccept ONESIMVS, but together with his Letters had ſent ONESIMVS himſelfe; who hauing now gone ſo long a iourney, as betwixt <hi>Rome</hi> and <hi>Coloſſus,</hi> could not now, with any hone<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtie, bee refuſed, leſt all his labour, in that ſo hard and tedious a iourney, ſhould be made fruſtrate. This latter I take to be the chiefe force of the Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument.</p>
                     <p>Here note then, that PAVL promiſing him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe much of PHILEMON, and truſting to the equitie of this cauſe, did not firſt write to PHI<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>LEMON, to know, if hee might, with his good leaue and liking, ſend ONESIMVS, but ſends both him and his Letters both at once. One would thinke, this was not ſo wiſely done of PAVL: For, firſt hee ſhould haue knowne, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
<pb n="212" facs="tcp:257:112"/> he ſent him, whether his Maſter would giue any entertainment to him, being come. For how, if PHILEMON ſhould haue ſent him backe a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine to PAVL, what a deale of toyle had ONE<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>SIMVS taken in vaine? It was eaſie for PAVL to foreſee this: Therefore PAVL ſending him in this manner, it is a manifeſt Argument, that hee did nothing doubt of PHILEMONS readineſſe to pleaſure him therein, which afterwards, <hi>Verſ.</hi> 21. he confeſſeth.</p>
                     <p>Hence then it is euident, that ſometimes Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians, of ſpeciall acquaintance, in ſome cauſes may preſume one vpon another; namely, when the cauſe is equall and honeſt; and then ſpecially, if we be their ſuperiors, vpon whom we preſume, not onely in calling, but alſo in well-deſeruing of them; as PAVL here was, ſee <hi>Verſe</hi> 19. Otherwiſe to preſume, is the part of a ſhameleſſe and impudent man.</p>
                     <p>Againe, wee are to learne, That when friends, well-deſeruing of vs, ſhall in ſuch cauſes as this was, ſo farre preſume vpon vs, that great incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueniences will follow, if wee graunt not their de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire, wee are not then lightly to deceiue their hopes: As here, if ONESIMVS had beene re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſed, his iourney had beene loſt, and hee muſt haue gone backe againe to PAVL: For it is likely, hee knew not where elſe to beſtow him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe.</p>
                     <p>This is the ground of PAVLS Argument in this place.</p>
                     <pb n="213" facs="tcp:257:112"/>
                     <p> In the Concluſion of the Argument, in the latter end of the Verſe, we are to obſerue in PAVLS exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, calling ONESIMVS <hi>his owne bowels,</hi> what great account is to be made of the meaneſt, being truly conuerted. Though with PAVL we were <hi>Apoſtles,</hi> yet we might not diſdaine the baſeſt Bondſlaue, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the ſonne of God. IOB durſt not contend with his ſeruants, becauſe they had the ſame Creator with himſelfe, faſhioning them in the ſame manner in the Wombe, as himſelfe; much leſſe then would he haue contended with ſuch ſeruants as had the ſame Redeemer, CHRIST IESVS, with himſelfe. The grace of God is no leſſe grace, which reſides in a poore ſeruant, then that which is ſeated in a rich and mightie man. A Diamond will ſhine euen in the durt. And as with men, the more they demit and debaſe themſelues, the greater is their glory; ſo is it here alſo with the grace of God, by debaſing it ſelfe, as it were, to reſpect the low degree of ſeruants, and to dwell in the Cottages of Poore men, rather then in the Palaces of proud Kings and Emperors, the more glorious and goodly is it; ſo farre is it off, that the baſe and obſcure condition ſhould any thing at all obſcure the brightneſſe of Gods grace, that abideth in them. Away then with that vaine and proud partialitie, condemned by S. IAMES, <hi>Chap.</hi> 2. 1.</p>

                     <p>In the Anſwer there are two things.</p>
                     <p>Firſt, a remouall of the falſe cauſe of ſending O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>NESIMVS, which PHILEMON might ſurmiſe; namely, that he was a burden to the Apoſtle, being ſtill the ſame old ONESIMVS that he was before. The Apoſtle affirmeth the contrarie, <hi>Whom I would haue retained;</hi> ſhewing withall, what reaſon he had to haue retained him, <hi>that in thy ſtead he might haue miniſtred vnto me in the bonds of the Goſpell.</hi> Where he ſhewes two commodities that would haue come by retaining him; firſt his owne, <hi>that he might haue mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nistred to me;</hi> ſecondly, PHILEMONS, <hi>in thy ſtead.</hi> PHILEMON by this meanes had beene freed of a burden which he was bound to vndergoe, namely, miniſtring to PAVL.</p>
                     <p>The ſecond thing in his Anſwer, is the ſetting downe of the true cauſe why he ſent him, in the 14. Verſe, <hi>But without thy mind I would doe nothing.</hi> He was ignorant of PHILEMONS mind, and ſo hee might haue kept and vſed his ſeruant againſt his liking: The which hee ſheweth would not haue beene well, by the commoditie that thence would haue enſued. The benefit of ONESIMVS miniſtring would haue beene forced, and not free; where hee implyes thus much, That if he were willing to ſend him back, he was not againſt it; yea he would rather haue it ſo, then he ſhould be hardly dealt with at home.</p>
                     <pb n="216" facs="tcp:257:114"/>
                     <p> For the firſt part of this Anſwer, from thence we learne,</p>
                     <p>Firſt, With how faſt a glue Chriſtians hearts are <label type="milestone">
                           <seg type="milestoneunit">Doct </seg>1</label> faſtened one to another, that they cannot be ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uered <note place="margin">The vnion of Chriſtian hearts.</note> without great ſence of griefe; and if it were poſſible, they would enioy alwayes the bodily pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence each of other, liuing and dying together. But more eſpecially is this affection betwixt Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters and the true members of the Church, ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially thoſe whom they haue conuerted by their Miniſterie. See this affection in PAVL towards the <hi>Romans,</hi> 1. 10, 11. and <hi>Theſſalonians,</hi> 1. <hi>Theſſ.</hi> 2. and <hi>Galat.</hi> 4. 20.</p>
                     <p>A iuſt rebuke to ſuch Non-reſidents, that haue not this affection to their Flockes; that doe wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lingly diuorce themſelues from them, comming onely amongſt them (ſometimes) to reape the fruits of the Earth, and not thoſe fruits whereof PAVL ſpeaketh, <hi>Rom.</hi> 1. 10. the reaping whereof was that which made him ſo deſirous to ſee the <hi>Romans.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>And as Miniſters are thus affected to their people; ſo, the people to them. See the exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of the <hi>Epheſians, Acts</hi> 20. towards PAVL; and of LIDIA, <hi>Acts</hi> 16. Of the Demoniacke, <hi>Luk.</hi> 8. 38. And of whole Multitudes, <hi>Luk.</hi> 4. 42. toward our Sauiour; of ELISHA to ELIAS, rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die to be rapt vp, and many ſuch like. But ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny, in theſe dayes, are rather like the <hi>Gadarens,</hi> louing the Miniſters roome better then their com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panie.</p>

                     <p> Secondly, From the end, whereby PAVL was <label type="milestone">
                           <seg type="milestoneunit">Doct. </seg>2</label> moued to deſire ONESIMVS companie with him ſtill. That he might miniſter to me in thy ſtead, in the Bonds of the Goſpell. We learne, that it is the dutie of euerie one of vs, both in our owne per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, and in thoſe that belong vnto vs, to be helpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full to the afflicted members of Chriſt, ſpecially for the Truth. A verie ſtrong Reaſon whereof, the Apoſtle layeth downe, calling his Bonds <hi>the Bonds of the Goſpell,</hi> in a moſt elegant kind of ſpeech; not ſo much by a Metonymie of the Cauſe, as I take it, becauſe the Goſpell procured him thoſe Bonds, but to ſignifie a further matter vnto vs, namely, that in him, the Goſpell it ſelfe, in a manner, was bound, though not in it ſelfe: For like a Mightie SAMSON, it will breake all Bonds whatſoeuer; and the Word of God cannot be bound, 2. <hi>Timoth.</hi> 3. yet in the endeuour of the Aduerſaries.</p>
                     <p>Therefore let vs not thinke, when a Miniſter of the Goſpell is caſt into Priſon for any Truth of the Goſpell, that it is onely the Miniſters owne Cauſe; nay, it is the common Cauſe of the Church: for through his ſides, they ſtrike at the Goſpell it ſelfe; which is to be reſpected of vs all. And therefore, if wee be wanting to him, wee forſake the Goſpell, and ſo Chriſt himſelfe, who one day will ſay vnto vs, <hi>I was in Priſon, and yee viſited me not.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>For the ſecond part of his Anſwer in the foure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teenth Verſe, thence we learne,</p>
                     <pb n="218" facs="tcp:257:115"/>
                     <p> Firſt, That the authoritie of Maſters ouer their <label type="milestone">
                           <seg type="milestoneunit">Doct. </seg>
                        </label> ſeruants, and ſo by like proportion, of Kings ouer <note place="margin">Religion abo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſhes not ciuill gouernment.</note> their ſubiects, is not taken away by Chriſtian Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion, but ſtill remaines in force, confirmed rather, then any thing impaired. ONESIMVS his conuer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion to the Faith, gaue him no manumiſſion and libertie from his Maſters ſeruice. PAVL here plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly acknowledgeth, that PHILEMON was ſpecially intereſted in ONESIMVS; and therefore, not know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing his mind, hee would not retaine him: and the benefit of ONESIMVS his miniſtring to him, is cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led PHILEMONS, That <hi>thy benefit</hi> might not be, &amp;c.</p>
                     <p>Seruants then, and all inferiors, muſt learne ſtill to acknowledge their Superiours and Gouernours, and not vnder the pretence of Religion, to ſhake off that yoke which God hath layed vpon them, and which, in truth, Religion faſteneth moſt ſurely vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on them. If before Religion, Maſter and Seruant, Prince and People, were out of ioynt, Religion comming, ſets them in, and eſtabliſheth both the King in his Throne, and the Maſter of a priuate Family, in that his authoritie ouer his Houſehold. This was a Doctrine, that many ſeruants in the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtles dayes could not well brooke; alledging, That if their Maſters were Infidels, then it was not fit, that they who are Chriſtians, ſhould ſerue ſuch, being, in regard of their Chriſtian calling, aboue them; and if they were beleeuers, then they were their equalls. The Anabaptiſts likewiſe at this day oppoſe this Doctrine, who would haue the Goſpel
<pb n="219" facs="tcp:257:115"/> crie downe all Ciuill Policie. But here we plainely ſee the diſtinction betweene Maſter and Seruant, yea, ſuch a Seruant as is a Bondſlaue, whoſe life is in the hands of his Maſter, to be confirmed: and ſurely, euen this kind of Bondage may ſtill ſtand, being vſed with Mercie and Moderation. Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments may be theſe:</p>
                     <p>Firſt, If we looke to the firſt originall, it will not ſeeme vnreaſonable. Now, the firſt originall, was the ſauing of thoſe whom they ſubdued in the Warres; Whence comes the Latine word, <hi>Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vus, quia in bello ſeruatus,</hi> becauſe he was preſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued in the Warre, taken captiue, and his life ſpared. Now, that ſuch mens ſeruice and ſubiection may be in a farre lower degree then other Seruants, who onely we hire for Money, may very well ſtand with equitie.</p>
                     <p>Secondly, The <hi>Iewes</hi> being captiued, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come NEBVCHADNEZZARS ſlaues, are comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded by God to quiet themſelues in that ſtate, and willingly to ſubiect themſelues to the Lordſhip of the <hi>Babylonians.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Thirdly, ABRAHAM had ſuch in his houſe, <hi>Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſ.</hi> 17. and the <hi>Iewes</hi> were permitted to haue ſuch, <hi>Leuit.</hi> 25. 45.</p>
                     <p>Fourthly, The Apoſtles in their Epiſtles impoſe ſubiection vpon Seruants, moſt of them then being Bondſlaues; ſee 1. <hi>Cor.</hi> 7. 21. <hi>Art thou called, being a Bondman?

And when occaſion is offered to vs of ſhewing any kindneſſe to our friends, ſpecially in the workes of beneficence to the poore, then this willing Spirit is to be ſought for, that we doe it not grudging and with indiſpoſed hearts. 2. <hi>Cor.</hi> 9. 7.

                     <p>The Argument is this: If his departure haue beene an occaſion to make him a Brother, a fellow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member with thee in Chriſt, then it was ſo carryed in Gods prouidence, that thou mighteſt receiue him for euer.

                        <p>Why then doth the Apoſtle vſe it? to what pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe? firſt, that hee might ſeeme to mitigate onely, and ſomething to extenuate the ſinne of ONESI<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>MVS, and not to commend it as a thing in it ſelfe good.</p>
                        <p>Secondly, becauſe it was thus carryed in Gods ſecret prouidence, and was no ordinarie courſe of conuerſation: otherwiſe, if he had ſpoken abſolute<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and confidently, wicked ſeruants would haue ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken occaſion hence to haue runne from their Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters, that they might be conuerted.</p>

                        <p> For the matter it ſelfe, there are two ſpeciall things here auouched co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>cerning ONESIMVS his de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parture. Firſt, the Author of it God, he was parted from thee; for ſo the word properly is to bee tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lated, rather then departed. If hee were parted and ſeparated from ONESIMVS, then there was a Separator, and that is God. Secondly, the end wherto God did diſpoſe this his ſeparation, <hi>that thou mighteſt receiue him for euer,</hi> which is amplified by the contrary oppoſition of his temporary abſence, <hi>he was parted only for a ſeaſon.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>For the firſt, God is the Author of this ſeparati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; not in that he did incite and ſtirre vp ONESI<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>MVS to ſteale, or runne away; for then he ſhould be the Author of ſinne; but becauſe that in his eternall Councell he hauing decreed his euents, doth now willingly ſuffer it, withdrawing his grace from O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>NESIMVS, and leauing him to Satan and his owne corruption, that his owne righteous Decree might come to paſſe.</p>
                        <p>Here then wee haue iuſt occaſion to conſider of <label type="milestone">
                              <seg type="milestoneunit">Doct. </seg>
                           </label> the infinite and vaſt gulfe of Gods prouidence, that <note place="margin">The infinite ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent of Gods prouidence.</note> extendeth it ſelfe to all things, euen the meaneſt, not onely to Kingdomes, but Families, and euery particular member therein, euen to poore bond<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſlaues: Inſomuch, that a bondſlaue cannot runne from his Maſter, without Gods ſpeciall prouidence. This muſt teach vs to admire the infinite depth of Gods Wiſedome and Knowledge. Wee thinke a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt our ſelues, that in a great Family, he that ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth charge of it, and all therein, and through whoſe
<pb n="227" facs="tcp:257:119"/> hands all things in the Family muſt paſſe, muſt needs be a man of ſpeciall parts. O then, the bot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tomeleſſe profunditie of Gods Wiſedome and Knowledge! that before all Worlds, did in one Act diſpoſe of all the ſeuerall actions of euery par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular man, yea, and all other creatures in the world beſides. How ſhould this make vs reſt and rely vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on God in our troubles, looking for that euent which hee in his prouidence hath appointed. If Gods prouidence reach to bondſlaues, how much more to others? If nothing come to paſſe in one poore Family without it, much leſſe in a whole Church: If in a Family, a ſeruant be not parted from his Maſter without Gods appointment, much leſſe in the Church are Miniſters taken away from their Flockes: And if ſuch thinges fall out by Gods prouidence, wee muſt quiet our ſelues in Gods will.</p>
                        <p>Secondly, The end is to be conſidered, why God parted ONESIMVS from his Maſter, <hi>That thou mightest receiue him for euer.</hi> This word, <hi>for euer,</hi> ſometimes ſignifies ſome ſett time; as oft in the Law, <hi>This is a ſtatute for euer,</hi> that is, during the old Couenant, till Chriſt. So we vſe to ſay, for euer, that is, during life. And ſo ſome take it here, <hi>That thou mighteſt receiue him for euer,</hi> as long as you both ſhall liue. But I rather take the wordes properly, <hi>for euer,</hi> that is, for all Eternities, as the wordes fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing, a proofe of theſe, doe cleare it, <hi>Not as a ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uant, &amp;c.</hi> but as a brother. Now this ſpirituall bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therhood betwixt ONESIMVS and PHILEMON,
<pb n="228" facs="tcp:257:120"/> was to laſt indeed for euer and euer, and not onely the ſhort ſpace of this preſent life.</p>
                        <p>Here obſerue, firſt, how God hath a hand euen <label type="milestone">
                              <seg type="milestoneunit">Doct. </seg>
                           </label> in thoſe actions of men which are ſinfull, namely, <note place="margin">How God hath an hand in ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full actions.</note> in regard of ordination and diſpoſing of them to good. ONESIMVS had no ſuch intent, in running away, to knit himſelfe in a more neere bond to his Maſter then before; no, he went with a deſperate mind, meaning to free himſelfe wholly from his Maſters ſeruice; little thought hee of conuerting; but yet contrarie to his owne intent, turned it to be a meanes of his conuerſion. So IOSEPHS brethren little thought of any good, when they ſold him; nay, they thought euill, as IOSEPH told them, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt him; but yet God turned it to good, to be the meanes of the preſeruation of the Church, in time of Famine. This muſt not make vs doe euill, that good may come of it, which we are forbidden, <hi>Rom.</hi> 3. for God onely hath this skill, by reaſon of his infinite Wiſedome and Power, to worke Good out of Euill, to draw Light out of Darkeneſſe. He onely hath the Philoſophers Stone, to turne Droſſe into Gold. In vaine therefore is it for vs to aſſay any ſuch thing. The right vſe of this Doctrine, is for vs to comfort our ſelues, when wee ſee wicked men plotting and practiſing miſchiefe againſt Gods poore Church. Their heads and hands worke not ſo faſt, but God workes as faſt. When they goe and ſtriue one way, he ſets them a worke another way; as the Sunne going in his owne proper motion one way, is euery day, by the violent circumvolution
<pb n="229" facs="tcp:257:120"/> of the Heauens, turned another way: nay, he makes their ſtriuing againſt his Glorie, and his Churches good, to be the meanes of furthering both: As in a Boat, when the Rowers goe with their faces ſtri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing towards the Eaſt, they ſet the Boat going apace towards the Weſt. ONESIMVS, in running away from his Maſters houſe, the Church of God, did as much as in him lay, ſtriue againſt his owne con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerſion, and yet it is made a meanes of conuerſion. IOSEPHS brethren, in ſelling him, thought to haue fruſtrated his Dreames, and to haue made him ſure for euer hauing dominion ouer them; and yet their ſelling of him, was the ſpeciall meanes of accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliſhing his Dreames. Satan, in Chriſts death, thought to haue wounded the Church to the death; and yet thereby we were healed of his dead<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly wounds. Euen as the man that was thruſt at with the Sword of his enemie, to be killed, was thereby cured of his Impoſtume. Thus HAMANS Plots to ouerthrow MORDECAI and the <hi>Iewes,</hi> were meanes to aduance them. This is the worke of the Lord, who knoweth how to catch the wiſe in their owne wyles, and it muſt be maruellous in our eyes. Let not then the Power and Policie of all the ACHI<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>TOPHELS and MACHIAVELS in the World, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bining themſelues againſt the Goſpell, diſmay vs; for God hath his Oare in their Boat, hee hath a ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciall ſtroke in all actions whatſoeuer, and can eaſily ouer-reach and make ſtarke fooles of the wiſeſt, by making their owne counſels and endeuours like CHVSHAIS, to ouerthrow thoſe intentions which they ſeeme to ſupport.</p>

                        <p> Secondly, Gods power in conuerſion is to be no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted; <label type="milestone">
                              <seg type="milestoneunit">Doct. </seg>2</label> who, as here wee ſee in ONESIMVS, lets men <note place="margin">Gods honour in our Conuerſion.</note> goe on a long time in their wicked courſes, till they come to the very height of wickedneſſe; and then, contrarie to all expectation, ſuddenly turnes them. ONESIMVS, all the while he liued in PHILEMONS houſe, a godly Maſter, vſing the beſt meanes for his good, ſtill grew worſe and worſe. Hauing now wofully baniſhed himſelfe out of this houſe, and ſo Gods preſence, was hee not now, in mans reaſon, deſperate and paſt all recouerie? But yet ſee here, how God purſues him, being runne away, makes huy and cry after him, ſeizes vpon him by his Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, and cauſeth him to returne to his heauenly Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter, and then his earthly. After the ſame manner was PAVL conuerted, <hi>Acts</hi> 9.</p>
                        <p>This God doth, firſt, That the worke of our Conuerſion might euidently appeare to bee his owne, and ſo hee might haue the ſole glorie of it. What diſpoſition of ONESIMVS his will could there be now, to conuert that Runne-away from the meanes of Conuerſion? In PAVL, when hee went with a mind to perſecute the Faith? Here then doth Gods power appeare, in that euen then, when wee are moſt rebellious and ſtiffe-necked, moſt vntoward and auerſe, yet euen then he catches vs, and makes vs yeeld, and drawes vs to Chriſt; making our wills, of ſtiffely nilling, deſirouſly wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling. And when we ſhall be conuerted on this man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, then ſhall wee forthwith be forced to admire our Conuerſion as a ſtrange miracle, and wholly
<pb n="231" facs="tcp:257:121"/> abaſing our ſelues, to giue all the glorie to God; reaſoning thus with our ſelues: Running downe ſo ſteepe a Hill, like a furious Horſe, in ſo mad a mood, I could neuer haue poſſibly ſtayed or ſaued my ſelfe, nor any man els. It was then, ſurely, the Diuine Power of God that hath done this.</p>
                        <p>Secondly, God taketh this courſe in our conuer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, that wee might cleaue the faſter vnto him in heartie and ſincere loue; for to whom much is for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giuen, they loue much. This made PAVL exceed his fellowes in zeale and painfulneſſe in his Apoſtle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip.</p>
                        <p>Thirdly, that hereby wee might learne to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpayre of none though neuer ſo outragious and vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent in ſinne; notwithſtanding many good meanes which God hath vſed to reclaime them. God is a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to call thoſe into his Vineyard at the twelfth houre, and to make them faithfull Labourers there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in, that one would thinke, by ſtanding idle ſo long, were ſo habituated and radicated in idleneſſe, that it were impoſſible for them to ſet themſelues to labour.</p>
                        <p>Thirdly, Gods manner in taking away ſome of his bleſſings oftentimes, is here to bee obſerued <label type="milestone">
                              <seg type="milestoneunit">Doct. </seg>3</label> 
                           <note place="margin">God reſtores our loſſes with ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uantage.</note> Surely, his taking of them<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> is but a kind of borrow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of them; that he (as it were) occupying of them for vs for a time, they might afterwards returne vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to vs in a holy kind of Vſurie, with vantage and great encreaſe. PHILEMON loſes ONESIMVS, and with him, and his ſeruice, ſome of his goods, which he tooke away with him; and yet ſee in the end,
<pb n="232" facs="tcp:257:122"/> how he loſes nothing by all this, but rather is made a great gainer. Whileſt ONESIMVS was with him before, hee could haue no great good of him, being an vngodly and vnfaithfull ſeruant: but now, in his abſence, God ſo workes vpon him, that hee makes him, of ONESIMVS before in name, onely ONESIMVS indeed, that is, truly profitable, as was ſhewed in the eleuenth Verſe: and hauing thus fit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted and prepared him for PHILEMON, he returnes him vnto him againe, not as he was before, but with vantage, ſuch vantage as might ſufficiently counter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uaile, not only the want of his ſeruice all the while of his abſence, but the loſſe alſo of PHILEMONS money; for a good ſeruant, ſuch a one as ONESIMVS was made now, is worth much Gold, and haply PHILEMON could not haue got ſuch a profitable Seruant as this new ONESIMVS was, no, though hee would haue giuen tenne times as much as that which ONESIMVS tooke away. But the ſaluation of his precious ſoule farre exceeded the worth of the whole World, and no doubt, if money might haue done his ſoule good, PHILEMON would haue thought it much more vile in compariſon. See then the increaſe of the abſence of ONESIMVS, and loſſe of his money.</p>
                        <p>This muſt teach vs patience, when God takes a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way any mercy from vs: for in his good time either it or as good, or a better thing ſhall returne vnto vs. ABRAHAM muſt part with ISAAK, and in a manner was taken from him, but preſently hee receiues him againe as a ſurer pledge of Gods loue,
<pb n="233" facs="tcp:257:122"/> and confirmation of his faith then before. At death our poore ſoules ſhall haue their bodies taken from them: yet wee muſt not bee diſcouraged; for they are ſeuered only for a ſeaſon, that they may re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turne againe for euer at the Reſurrection, and that in another manner then wee left them, not mortall and coruptible, but glorious and ſpirituall bodies, 1. <hi>Cor.</hi> 15.</p>
                        <p>Sometimes God taketh away his Word and Goſpell and Miniſtery from his people, as he did in Queene MARIES dayes. But how? Only for a ſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, that they might haue it againe afterward more confirmed and better eſtabliſhed then before, as it was in worthy Queene ELIZABETHS dayes. Sometimes, which is worſt of all, God himſelfe de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parts from vs, and hides his face, as <hi>Exod.</hi> 33. from the Church of the <hi>Iſraelites,</hi> but it is but for a ſeaſon, <hi>for a little while, for a moment, Eſai.</hi> 44. 7, 8. that hee might make vs the more ſeeke after him, and ſo re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turne vnto vs afterward with greater comfort, ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king the falling out of louers to be only the renuing of loue. Specially muſt this point be thought vpon, when wee are called to ſuffer for the Truths ſake, the loſſe of outward comforts of life, as Libertie, Lands, Liuing, yea, Life it ſelfe: <hi>He that loſes his life for my Names ſake, ſhall find it,</hi> ſayes our Sauiour. We loſe theſe things no otherwiſe, then the Huſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bandman loſeth his Seed: for the loſſe of theſe things is but as Seed caſt into the ground, which ſhall euen in this life, according to our Sauiours promiſe, returne vnto vs the increaſe of a <hi>hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreth</hi>
                           <pb n="234" facs="tcp:257:123"/> 
                           <hi>fold, and in the World to come life eternall Mat.</hi> 19.</p>
                        <p>Fourthly, Note the priuiledge of the ſpirituall Coniunction in Chriſt, aboue any other ciuill Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iunction whatſoeuer, that it laſts for euer. <hi>That thou mightest receiue him for euer.</hi> Ciuill Societies and Coniunctions whatſoeuer ſhall end, onely this ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rituall Coniunction ſhall continue eternall.</p>
                        <p>This muſt teach thoſe that are conioyned each <label type="milestone">
                              <seg type="milestoneunit">Doct. </seg>4</label> to other in ciuill and carnall Coniunctions of kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red <note place="margin">The ſpirituall Coniunction is eternall.</note> and callings in the World, as Huſband and Wife, Maſter and Seruant, Parents and Children, to labour likewiſe to bee conioyned together in Chriſt; for the other Coniunction will not hold long, and if they bee not knit together likewiſe in the bond of the Spirit. O then there will bee a wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full parting, euen betwixt thoſe that are knit faſteſt and neereſt together in theſe fleſhly bonds, the Huſband and the Wife! <hi>Two ſhall bee in one bed, one ſhall bee refuſed, the other ſhall bee receiued.</hi> It ſerueth alſo for comfort to Chriſtians, when by death, car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall Coniunctions are diſſolued, for ſtill the ſpiritu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all Coniunction continueth.</p>
                        <p>Fiftly, from the ſcope of the Apoſtle in theſe <label type="milestone">
                              <seg type="milestoneunit">Doct. </seg>5</label> wordes, obſerue that the conſideration of that <note place="margin">The good end of croſſes muſt quiet vs.</note> good end whereto God turneth thoſe things which are grieuous vnto vs, whether iniuries offred vs by men, or afflictions immediately by his owne hand, muſt quiet our minds, and miniſter content<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment vnto vs. It could not chooſe but bee a great griefe to PHILEMON for ONESIMVS
<pb n="235" facs="tcp:257:123"/> to runne away: for beſides his owne loſſe of the money, he grieued, no doubt, much more for ONE<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>SIMVS owne ſake, who was poſting on in the high and readie way to Hell, and for the Goſpels ſake, which was ſubiect to the ſlanders of the wicked, vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on occaſion of this accident falling out in the houſe of ſuch a Profeſſor and Preacher as PHILEMON was: yet here PAVL ſtops his mouth with this, that this was turned now both to his owne and ONESI<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>MVS his good.</p>
                        <p>Afflictions for the preſent are grieuous, but when they ſhall bring with them happy fruits, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther that of righteouſneſſe, <hi>Heb.</hi> 12. or any other, whether to our ſelues or others, wee are then to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ioyce more in that, then we were grieued before in our owne hurt. Thus IOSEPH quieted himſelfe in thoſe iniuries which his Brethren had done him, and would not nouriſh any deſire of reuenge in his minde, becauſe God had turned them all to ſo great a good.</p>
                        <p>Now, howſoeuer, whileſt wee are in the bit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terneſſe of our afflictions, wee ſee not what is that good whereunto God will diſpoſe it in the end, yet ſure we haue the promiſe of God, <hi>that all things ſhall worke together for our good, Rom.</hi> 8. and wee haue heretofore in our owne and others experiences ſeene the like practice of God. This muſt make vs comfortable in the midſt of our diſtreſſe, knowing aſſuredly that God will make a good and happie end of it. And then wee ſhall condemne our ſelues of folly, in wiſhing our owne hurt and
<pb n="236" facs="tcp:257:124"/> hinderance; then wee ſhall thanke GOD for our croſſes, being made meanes of that good which wee would not for any good haue miſſed. Bee not then impatient, fret not, murmure not at any iniuries whatſoeuer, or any afflictions whatſoeuer that befall thee: wait a while, and thou ſhalt ſee GODS ſpeciall prouidence ouer thee in thoſe croſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, inſomuch that thou wouldeſt not for any thing but thoſe croſſes had befalne thee. <hi>Martha,</hi> though ſhee was grieued much at her Brother LAZARVS death, and beganne euen to murmure, ſaying, <hi>Lord, if thou haddeſt beene here, my Brother had not dyed,</hi> yet afterward when ſhee ſaw her Brother rayſed againe, and by this, many to beleeue in CHRIST, then ſhee could not but wonder at her owne folly, that would haue hindered that ſo glorious a worke of God, and the ſaluation of ſo ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny ſoules.</p>

                     </p>
                     <p>How then doe they ſhew themſelues Brethren, that doe bite, yea, and deuoure thoſe that are of the ſame holy Profeſſion with themſelues? Euen as in the Sea the greater Fiſhes ſwallow vp the leſſer.</p>
                     <p>When there bee Schiſmes and Factions, parta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kings in the Church, EPHRAIM againſt MANAS<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>SES, and MANASSES againſt EPHRAIM, and the Children of the Church ſtriue together in her wombe, as once ESAV and IAAKOB; it argueth that ſome at leaſt are vnnaturall Brethren.</p>
                     <p>Againe, it is the part of Brethren to take one a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nothers part, to cleaue one to another, taking that which is done to their Brother, as done to them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues, as wee ſee in the examples of IAAKOBS ſonnes, taking the abuſe offered to their ſiſter, as to themſelues, and thinking it a ſufficient excuſe for their ioyning together in the reuenge of the <hi>Siche<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mites:</hi> it was done in their ſiſters quarrell. <hi>Should they abuſe our ſister as a Whore?</hi> Well, ſpirituall Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther-hood ought to bee more effectuall then natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall: <hi>for there is a friend that is aboue a brother, Prou.</hi> 16. that is, the Chriſtian friend, who alſo is a ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall Brother. In euill cauſes therefore ſhall natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall Brethren thinke themſelues excuſed, that they doe it in defence of their Brethren, and to manifeſt their naturall affection? How then ſhall we be able
<pb n="239" facs="tcp:257:125"/> to excuſe our ſelues, if in good cauſes we flinch one from another, as DEMAS and diuers others did from PAVL, leauing him to anſwere for himſelfe? O, this is not the part of good Brothers. How doe wee ſhew our ſelues Brethren, Sonnes of the ſame heauenly Father, when wee will not ioyne to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether in thoſe things which are for the honour of that our Father, and the good of our Mother the Church?</p>
                     <p>Thirdly, it is the propertie of a Brother, though at other times hee haue beene ſomething more vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kinde to his Brother, yet in his affliction and extremitie, then to feele nature working in him, and to ſhew and expreſſe his affection by doing his beſt.</p>
                     <p>This is that which SAEOMON noteth, <hi>Prou.</hi> 17. 17. <hi>A friend loueth at all times, and a brother is borne for aduerſitie.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Wherefore, howſoeuer in the time of peace wee haue not ſo manifeſted our loue to Chriſtians as wee ought to haue done, yet in perſecution, if there be any brotherly affection, we cannot then containe it, nay, then it will breake forth: Then wee ſhall cry out amaine as <hi>Ioſeph</hi> did, though before, with him, wee hide and diſſembled our affections, <hi>I am</hi> IOSEPH <hi>your brother.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>In Hiſtories we read, that CROESVS his ſonne ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing beene alwayes dumbe, yet the Citie being ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prized by enemies, he ſeeing one ready to kill his fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, Nature ſo wrought in him, that it violently (as it were) broke the impediments and ſtrings of his
<pb n="240" facs="tcp:257:126"/> tongue, &amp; cauſed him to cry out with great paſſion: <hi>O kill not King</hi> CRoeSVS.</p>
                     <p>If we then will ſhew our ſelues true and naturall Sonnes of God, and ſo brethren to his children, when wee ſee his Honour readie to be trod vnder foote, when we ſee his children euill intreated, then is it high time for vs to manifeſt our affection.</p>
                     <p>A notable example of this we haue in MOSES, whoſe brotherly affection towards the perſecuted <hi>Iſraelites,</hi> all the pompe and pleaſure of PHARAOHS Court was not able to ſmother and ſuppreſſe, but it brake forth in that manner, that it cauſed him to relinquiſh the Court and all his hopes there, and to chooſe rather to ſuffer affliction with the people of God.</p>
                     <p>Naturall kindred in ſome caſes may be concea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led, and ſpecially in the caſe of danger, as ESTHER was counſelled by MORDECAI, to conceale of what Countrey ſhee was. But our ſpirituall kindred leaſt of all may be concealed in the time of danger and trouble; nay, then is the tryall of it; for as by SA<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>LOMONS wiſedome, going about to cut that con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trouerted childe in two, the naturall mother was diſcerned: ſo the like wiſedome of God, ſuffering our brethren in the Faith to be in like manner dealt withall, as the childe ſhould by SALOMON, our affections are tryed, and true brothers are notably diſcerned, and baſe ones detected.</p>
                     <p>Let this be remembred then of vs, that profeſſe the ſame holy Truth, that wee are Brothers, yea, Twinnes, and therefore wee muſt alwayes bee knit
<pb n="241" facs="tcp:257:126"/> together in a holy harmonie of wills and affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, reioycing and weeping, liuing and dying to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether. If wee finde theſe qualities and proper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties of brethren in our ſelues, it is no matter for the Worlds ſcorning at this brotherhood, it is our glorie.</p>
                     <p>Secondly, Obſerue that this ſpirituall brother<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood <label type="milestone">
                           <seg type="milestoneunit">Doct. </seg>2</label> is betwixt all Chriſtians indifferently, what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoeuer <note place="margin">The ſpirituall brotherhood is a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong all Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians indiffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rently.</note> difference there bee amongſt them in out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward ciuill reſpects, yet they are nothing preiudi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciall to this ſpirituall Fraternitie in Chriſt: for here PHILEMON and ONESIMVS, the Maſter and the Seruant, are made theſe kind of brethren. Howſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>euer we are differenced in ciuill policie and in ciuill ſocieties, ſome being Noble, ſome being Baſe, ſome Rich, ſome Poore, &amp;c. yet in that ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall ſocietie, of which CHRIST is the Head, there is no ſuch diſtinction. Here wee are all e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>qualls, all one, all brethren: Chriſt in his body giues no ſpeciall place to a King, becauſe hee is a King; no, hee reſpects not the King, more then the Begger.</p>
                     <p>This Doctrine is of ſpeciall vſe, both for com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort to Inferiours, and for humiliation and modera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of minde to Superiours, in as much as the ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uant is Chriſts Free-man, and the Maſter is Chriſts ſeruant, 1. <hi>Corinth.</hi> 7. <hi>Let then the brother of low de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree reioyce in this, that he is exalted,</hi> IAMES 1. in Chriſt, to be equall with the greateſt Prince in the world, yea, to bee aboue him, if hee bee out of Chriſt. Againe, as Saint IAMES counſells in the
<pb n="242" facs="tcp:257:127"/> ſame place: <hi>Let the brother of high degree reioyce in his humilitie,</hi> euen in this, that in Chriſt hee hath made equall with himſelfe the meaneſt. Let him not reioyce in his outward preeminence hee hath o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer them, but let him know this is his glorie, which in the world is counted humilitie, that he hath ſuch a poore begger his equall. And ſurely, we haue no cauſe to bee aſhamed of them that bee poore, to bee our brethren: for if God acknowledge them to bee his Sonnes, I hope, it is no diſparagement to any, to acknowledge them their brethren, nay, a credit, and, as Saint IAMES ſheweth, <hi>A matter to be boa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſted in,</hi> for if we haue them our brethren, then we haue God our Father. And if we denie them to be the Sonnes of God, who bee our brethren, in ſo doing wee openly diſclaime God from being our Father.</p>
                     <p>Let vs then acknowledge the pooreſt Chriſtian as our brother, though our owne bond-ſlaue, do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the parts and offices of a brother vnto him. Naturall men oftentimes, by the force of naturall affection, acknowledge their naturall brethren, though they themſelues be highly exalted aboue them in the world. And ſhall not grace exceed na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture? ſhall not brothers in the Lord much more e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uery way acknowledge their brethren, though they be neuer ſo much aduanced aboue them in their ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uill calling? The Chriſtian calling will not ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>throw the ciuill. Religion will not ouerthrow Poli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie, nay, rather it confirmes this. It will not teach thy ſeruant to ſlip his necke out of the collar, and
<pb n="243" facs="tcp:257:127"/> to denie thee ſeruice and ſubiection: why then ſhould Policie be ſo vnkind and vnthankfull to Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, as to ouerthrow it? Though, in truth, it is not ſo much Policie, as our corruption, taking oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion by ciuill Policie, that would ouerturne Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion.</p>
                     <p>It is the pride of mens hearts puffed vp, in regard of the outward condition in the world, that makes them forget their inferiours, and ſo to carry them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues towards them, as if they were not their bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren of the ſame Chriſtian Calling, of the ſame precious Faith with themſelues. Neither is this ſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken, as though Superiours might not lawfully main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tayne their ſuperioritie and authoritie ouer their Inferiours, but onely that their inequalitie in their ciuill calling, cauſe them not to forget the equalitie in the Chriſtian. And this is a point of great wiſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome, ſo to temper our carriage, that neither our equalitie in Chriſt make vs to forget our inequalitie in the world, nor yet on the other ſide our inequali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie in the world, make vs forget our equalitie in Chriſt.</p>
                     <p>Againe, this Doctrine teacheth Superiours, not onely moderation to others their Inferiours, but al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo all humilitie and ſubiection towards GOD. A good Meditation is it for them, ſeeing their Inferi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ours in the world creeping and crouching to thinke thus with themſelues: O, this man is my brother, not onely in regard of creation of the ſame ſtuffe with my ſelfe, but alſo of regeneration, hee is as good, as I, before God. O then how ought I much
<pb n="244" facs="tcp:257:128"/> more to abaſe my ſelfe before my heauenly Maſter, caſting downe my ſelfe at his foote-ſtoole, though a King, with the meaneſt Begger, comming to Gods Houſe with all my Subiects, as their Companion, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 122!</p>

                        <p>THat which PAVL preſſes PHILEMON vnto, hee vrges from his owne example, by an Argument drawne from the leſſe to the greater, on this wiſe.</p>
                        <p>I deſire nothing of thee, but what firſt I doe my ſelfe. I plead but for that affection from thee toward ONESIMVS, which I my ſelfe beare to him. If he be deare to me, then much more ought hee to bee ſo to thee, for I am tyed to him, but in one bond, as he is a Chriſtian: but thou art bound to him with a twofold cord which cannot be eaſily broken. Onely ſpirituall and gracious reſpects challenge affection from mee, but together with theſe doe outward and naturall bonds plead for regard from thee, who art bound to him <hi>both in the fleſh and in the Lord,</hi> both as he is a ſeruant, and as a Chriſtian ſeruant. Hee is deare to mee onely as a member of the houſhold of Faith, thou art alſo bound to him as a member of thine owne houſhold. If then I vpon this ſingle bond hold him ſo deare, how deare then ſhould he be to thee, thus doubly ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liged to him? The reaſon may be drawne into this forme.</p>
                        <p>If I PAVL, thus dearely loue ONESI<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>MVS, then oughteſt thou, PHILEMON, to doe the like: But I dearely loue him. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, &amp;c.</p>
                        <pb n="246" facs="tcp:257:129"/>
                        <p> The Conſequence of his Argument hee pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueth thus: Hee that is bound to a man by a double bond, ought to regard him more then he that is bound to him by a ſingle bond: But thou art bound to ONESIMVS by a double bond, I, but by a ſingle one: Therefore, &amp;c.</p>
                        <p>Firſt, PAVL vrges PHILEMON from his <label type="milestone">
                              <seg type="milestoneunit">Doct. </seg>1</label> owne example. I loue him, Therefore oughteſt <note place="margin">Miniſters ſhould be exemplarie in what they teach.</note> thou, and what I require at thine hands I doe my ſelfe. I, that plead for affection, doe ſhew affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction. I, that call for loue, doe ſhew loue. Then a man pleades ſtrongly indeed, when hee makes himſelfe a precedent.</p>
                        <p>Miniſters ſhould bee exemplarie in all they vrge, and teach. Then is there life in their Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine, when there is Doctrine in their life.

                        <p>The want of ſight cauſes the want of Faith. Except, with THOMAS in another caſe, they ſee, they will not beleeue.

                        <p>It is poore comfort for a Miniſter to be no fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther then a Phariſe.

                        <p>To vſurpe MOSES his Chaire, and not to o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen MOSES his Law, is to be worſe then a Pha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſe.

                        <p>Phyſicians and Miniſters that in diuers things doe agree, yet herein muſt diſagree.

So that he pleads here much after that manner, <hi>Phil.</hi> 2. 1. 2. <hi>If any communion or fellow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip</hi>

The reaſon then ſtands thus. If we haue communion and fellowſhip together in all things, then receiue him: but wee haue ſuch a fellowſhip: therefore receiue him, which concluſion is farther illuſtrated, by the manner how hee would haue him be receiued, <hi>As my ſelfe.</hi> In which reaſon two things may bee conſidered, 1 The force. 2 The ground of it.</p>
                     <p n="1">1 The force of it. And that teaches thus much.</p>
                     <p>That the communion which is betweene Saints, <label type="milestone">

So much im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plies the force of this argument, for PAVL reaſons from the communion that is betweene them, that he ought to regard his requeſt. This argument hath a kinde of adiuring force with it: for either doe the duties of this communion; or, in effect, thou denieſt this communion. So <hi>Phil.</hi> 2. 1. 2. <hi>If any fellowſhip ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fill my ioy, that yee be like minded. &amp;c.</hi> As if hee had ſayd, you profeſſe a communion and fellowſhip a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt you, I adiure you by this fellowſhip which you profeſſe, to performe theſe duties of loue and peace. ABRAHAMS argument to LOT buts much vpon this. <hi>Gen.</hi> 13. 8. <hi>Let there be no ſtrife betweene mee and thee, for wee are brethren.</hi> That communion which is betweene Saints ſhould make them faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full in the performance of all duties, that belong to their fellow-Saints. <hi>If thou count me a partner.</hi> There is a partnerſhip betweene Chriſtians, they are fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low-partners.

Call vpon him, aduiſe him, help him, and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rect him how hee may thriue. Eſpecially doe ſuch Miniſters tranſgreſſe the lawes of this partnerſhip, who hide their talent in a napkin, and dig it into the earth and returne not the aduantage of it to the common treaſury of the Church. Their gifts are not their owne, but they are the common goods of the Church. It is odious to encloſe Commons: Church-robbery is ſacrilegious and infamous. How can they eſcape that infamy, that denie Gods Church the benefit and vſe of thoſe gifts, God hath giuen them for his Churches ſake. Many ſpeake a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt Impropriations, and iuſtly; but the ſpight is, that in the meane time they marre, or at leaſt wrong a good cauſe, with their owne guiltineſſe. For
<pb n="267" facs="tcp:257:139"/> while they ſpeake againſt <hi>temporall,</hi> they themſelues are guilty of <hi>ſpirituall Impropriations,</hi> and the world reckons, and not amiſſe, that the impropriations of Church-graces, is a greater ſinne then the impropri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation of Church-goods.</p>

Wee muſt breake off, and giue vp partnerſhip with all o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther companions and companies, now we are once admitted into this holy ſociety. The concluſion of the argument is amplified in thoſe words, <hi>as my ſelfe,</hi> that is, in regard of truth and ſincerity of loue, though not for meaſure and degree: for Chriſtian loue, though it muſt be in truth to all the houſhold of faith, yet requires not an equality of affection to
<pb n="268" facs="tcp:257:140"/> all. All our Sauiours Diſciples were loued of him heartily and truely, yet IOHN was the ſpeciall be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loued Diſciple aboue the reſt. So that PHILEMON is not required with the ſame reſpect and meaſure of of affection, to receiue a ſeruant, though religious, as an Apoſtle, but hee entreats him with as true, though not with ſo great loue, to receiue him as hee would receiue PAVL. And ſurely, the former part<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerſhip requires ſo much. The ſame thing which had made PAVL &amp; PHILEMON partners, had alſo now made PAVL and ONESIMVS partners. And therefore the ſame partnerſhip that bound PHILE<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>MON to receiue PAVL, bindes him alſo to receiue ONESIMVS as PAVL, becauſe hee is now admit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted into the ſame ſociety of partnerſhip with them both.

The ſame CHRIST, the attractiue of our loue being in both, why not the ſame affection and loue to both.

If the man be new, why ſhould the old names of his ſinnes re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maine, and be caſt in his teeth? In a mans conuerſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on olde things are paſſed away, and all things are be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come new.

Their ſinnes that haue repented, ſhould not bee rehearſed at all, but when there is ſome neceſſary cauſe; yea, and euen then without all rigidity and harſhneſſe of broad language, and in ſuch eaſie and gentle phraſe, as it may appeare, that wee are vnwilling but to remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber what is paſt. Indeede, the repenting ſinner him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe, ſpeaking of his ſinnes, eſpecially in his con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſions to God, thinkes he cannot haue termes odi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous enough, wherewithall to aggrauate his offences, he ſpeakes of them in the broadeſt and fowleſt man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner he can: but yet when hee hath repented and te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtified the ſame, we muſt auoyd the harſhneſſe, and ſpeak of them in the eaſieſt ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ner we can. PAVL con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſes of himſelfe more then LVKE reports of him, <hi>I was a blaſphemer &amp; a perſecuter.</hi> 1 <hi>Tim,</hi> 1. 13. LVKE reports of him <hi>Acts</hi> 9. that hee breathed out threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nings,
<pb n="273" facs="tcp:257:142"/> but not that hee breathed out blaſphemies. If GOD haue haue remitted, why ſhould we retain? why ſhould not we pardon where hee doth? How doth it appeare that wee pardon, when wee ſpeake with the harſheſt and rougheſt, of an offendor. How gently doth the Scripture ſpeake of DAVIDS fowle fact after his repentance, He was a man after GODS owne heart in all things, <hi>ſaue in the matter of Vriah,</hi> 1 <hi>King.</hi> 15. 5. both forgetting many offences, and ſpeaking of that groſſe one with an eaſie phraſe, ſaue in the <hi>matter of Vriah,</hi> not ſaue in the <hi>murther of V<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riah;</hi> It is good in the praiſes of our brethren, to giue them the full of their deſart, but in their falls vpon their repentance, to bee compaſſionate and gentle. But we are moſt commonly of a cleane con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary diſpoſition; In praiſes we haue our diminuent and extenuating termes; in offences, yea after re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance, wee haue the gift of amplification. To ſpeake eaſily in a mans praiſes, as it argues enuy; ſo to ſpeak harſhly of a repenters offences, argues rigor and ſeuerity. How many of vs haue the elder bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers euill eye and euill tongue, <hi>Luk.</hi> 15. 15. The Prodigalls father, after his ſons repentance, neither tels him of ryoting, nor whoring; but onely this, <hi>This my ſon was dead, and is aliue; he was loſt, and is found.</hi> How eaſily and like a father ſpeakes hee of his ſonnes groſſe miſdemeanours? But how ſpeaks the elder brother? ſurely broadly enough, and not like a brother: for as hee can neither brooke to call him brother, but <hi>this thy ſonne,</hi> ſo neither ſpares hee to ſpeake plainely, and with the moſt odious aggra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uating
<pb n="274" facs="tcp:257:143"/> termes, <hi>But when this thy ſonne was come, which hath deuoured thy liuing with harlots,</hi> &amp;c. Hee broadly charges him with ryot, and whoredome at once. But Chriſtian moderation teaches more milde language and carriage towards poore penitent ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners. It is good to turne this vindictiue edge vpon our owne ſinnes, and to ſet them out to the full in our confeſſions. If this ſharp edge were more vſed againſt our owne ſinnes, other mens ſhould finde and feele it farre more blunt. But becauſe the backe edge is toward our ſelues, therefore is the ſharp edge againſt others.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>If hee owes thee ought:</hi> PAVL then acknowledges <label type="milestone">
                           <seg type="milestoneunit">Doct. </seg>2</label> that ONESIMVS was indebted to PHILEMON, by <note place="margin">Communion of Saints makes not a communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of goods.</note> reaſon of that wrong done him. The Communion of Saints then makes not an abſolute community of goods. For were the right of mens goods com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon, ONESIMVS now being become a Chriſtian, was vpon thoſe tearmes to haue beene forgiuen the debt, and PAVL needed not to haue beene ouer offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious, in taking the debt vpon himſelfe. That com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munity of the Anabaptiſts, takes away the diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction of borrower and lender, of debitour and credi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tour. Though, as before wee ſayd, the Saints haue all things common, yet this communion preiudices not their priuate rights and poſſeſſions. Priuate poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſions will ſtand with the Saints Communion. Elſe from this <hi>Community</hi> might ONESIMVS, or PAVL for him, haue pleaded an <hi>Immunity</hi> both from reſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution and puniſhment. If IOHN BAPTIST had beene an Anabaptiſt, he would both haue condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
<pb n="275" facs="tcp:257:143"/> the ſouldiers for their callings, and haue com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mended, or at leaſt not haue condemned them for their courſes. <hi>Luk.</hi> 3. 14. For what wrong or vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence is it for a man to take that, to which hee hath as good a right as another? If goods be common, he does another no violence, that takes his goods. And to what end doth the Apoſtle euery where ſo ſtirre vp men to the duty of Almes, if hee allowed this community, in which euery man might be his own caruer, &amp; releeue himſelfe as his need was. There is no place for almes, where all are ioynt and equall owners. Our Sauiour teaches to pray for <hi>our daily bread,</hi> and PAVL enioynes men to eat their <hi>owne bread,</hi> 2 <hi>Theſſ.</hi> 3. 12. If wee may haue bread of our owne, why not all other things of our owne. In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deede the Apoſtle wiſhes vs ſo <hi>to buy, as though wee poſſeſſed not, and to vſe this world, as though wee vſed it not,</hi> 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 7. 30. 31. But hee doth no more forbid poſſeſſions in the world, then the vſe of the world. If not lawfull to poſſeſſe, then not lawfull to vſe the world; and if lawfull to vſe, then lawfull to poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſe. The Apoſtle forbids not poſſeſſing in, but being poſſeſſed of the world, <hi>It remaines, that they that haue wiues be as they that haue none,</hi> ſaith the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle in the ſame place. Now doth hee (thinke wee) thereby giue liberty to vncleanneſſe, and proſtitute other mens wiues by a <hi>Nicolaitan</hi> community? No<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>thing leſſe, for verſ. 2. of the ſame chapter, hee en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ioynes <hi>euery man to haue his owne wife, and euery wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man to haue her owne husband.</hi> He therfore no more allowes community of goods, then of wiues. The
<pb n="276" facs="tcp:257:144"/> drift of that place ſutes with that parable, wherein one pleads hee had bought a farme, when his farme had bought him: another, that hee had married a wife, when his wife had married him, and teaches not a community, but an holy kinde of neglect of all earthly things, and to haue our conuerſion in heauen, while wee liue heere on earth.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. The vndertaking of the debt. That is in theſe words, <hi>Put that on mine account, I Paul haue written it with mine owne hand, I will repay it.</hi> He vndertakes it by giuing him a bill of his hand. If there were no remedy, but ſatisfaction muſt be made, though yet hee hoped for a remiſſion, then hee vndertakes for him, hee will bee his ſurety, and make the debt his owne.</p>
                     <p>It is not vnlawfull for one man to become ſurety <label type="milestone">
                           <seg type="milestoneunit">Doct. </seg>1</label> for another. It is a worke of mercy, and a worke <note place="margin">Suretiſhip law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full, but with cautions.</note> which not onely may be done, but ſometimes muſt be done. So IVDAH became ſurety to his father for BENIAMIN <hi>Gen.</hi> 43. 9. <hi>I will bee ſurety for him, of mine hand ſhalt thou require him.</hi> So the good Sama<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritan vndertooke, and became ſurety for the woun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded man. <hi>Luk.</hi> 10. 35. And <hi>Heb.</hi> 7. 22. CHRIST be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came our <hi>Surety.</hi> Had it beene vnlawfull, though PAVL hoped for remiſſion, yet would he haue ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtained from all appearance of euill, and would not haue engaged himſelfe for ONESIMVS. It is a poynt indeed, in which men may miſcarry on both hands, both by an ouer great forwardneſſe to wrong themſelues, and an ouer great backwardneſſe in hel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping others. Heere therefore wee muſt remember
<pb n="277" facs="tcp:257:144"/> ſome cautions in the practiſe of this poynt. For true charity is alwayes guided by the wiſdome of God to walke betweene credulity and ſuſpicion, ſo as neither to wrong a mans ſelfe, nor yet others in the neglect of any duty of loue. The cautions to be obſerued therefore, are in regard</p>

PAVL here vrges PHILEMON to do the thing hee requeſted, becauſe it would reioyce him, theſe will doe the cleane contrary things to thoſe they required, becauſe they know it will bee matter of greefe and vexation, and take more delight in rip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping vp and rending, then in refreſhing their Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters bowels.</p>

Nothing ſhould more ioy our hearts, then the ſpirituall good of our brethren. But of this before v. 7.</p>

ONESIMVS being his owne bowels, in receiuing ONESIMVS hee ſhall refreſh his bowels. But I rather take the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer to be the true ſenſe.</p>
                     <p>See what great comfort and content Miniſters <label type="milestone">

Meats and drinks doe not more refreſh, and content the hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gry, and thirſty mans bowels, then the obedience of people refreſhes the hearts of Gods miniſters. Great is the labour of the miniſtery, full of ſore toyle and paines, but yet all the paine is ſwallowed vp with that ioy peoples obedience yeelds. <hi>My meat is to doe</hi>
                        <pb n="292" facs="tcp:257:152"/> 
                        <hi>my fathers will. Ioh.</hi> 4. It is meat and drinke to good hearts, not onely to doe, but alſo to teach the will of GOD. But when they teach it, and ſee others thereby brought alſo to doe it, this goes as a refre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhing oyle into their bowells. Me thinks this might ſomewhat mooue people to yeeld obedience to the Miniſtry of the word. Many would often ſeeme to pity vs, and doe acknowledge the toile of this Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteriall buſineſſe. Doeſt thou pity the Miniſter in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deede? Doth it pity thee to ſee his wearineſſe, and how his ſpirits and ſtrength are ſpent? out of thy pity then <hi>refreſh his bowells.</hi> Refreſh him with thine obedience. This will reuiue him after all his wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rineſſe, this will put life, and vigor, and ſpirits afreſh into him againe, when hee ſhall ſee his labour well beſtowed. The ioy in the ſucceſſe of their labours fills them with more ſpirits, then the labours of their body ſpent. Then is the Miniſtry a weariſome worke indeede, when after a great deale of ſore la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour, a man hath no recreation or refreſhment; but is more wearied and tyed with the ſight of mens hardneſſe, then with the hardneſſe of the labour. The onely cordiall and ſweet refectiue, after the weariſome worke of the Miniſtry, is the ſucceſſe of our labours. Why then will men deale thus vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kindely with vs, thus hardly and cruelly with vs, to denie vs our refreſhings after our labours? why deale men worſe with vs, then ordinary ſeruants; yea, then their beaſts? Thy beaſt after his day-la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour, wherewith hee is wearied and tired, hee ſhall haue his bait and lodging to refreſh him, and wilt
<pb n="293" facs="tcp:257:152"/> thou not vſe thy Miniſter as kindely as thy beaſt? pity his great paines and wearineſſe, and recreate and refreſh him with thine obedience. Many when they ſee the labour of the Miniſtry, would giue eaſe to the paines therof, with that ſpeech of PETERS to our Sauiour in another caſe, <hi>Matth.</hi> 16. <hi>Maſter pitie thy ſelfe,</hi> what neede you take ſo great paines? But to let paſſe that anſwer giuen to PETER, fitly ſuiting with their counſell, <hi>Thou ſauoureſt not the things that be of God, but thoſe that be of men,</hi> wee deſire them to pity and refreſh vs by their taking of more profit, and not to bee pitied or refreſhed by our owne ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king leſſe paines.

                     <p>HEere is a ſecret preuention of an obiection, that might ariſe in PHILEMONS minde in ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther kinde, then any of the other were. PAVLS im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunity, and often preſſing, and earneſt vrging of PHILEMON, might happily haue occaſioned him to nouriſh this hard conceit againſt PAVL, that hee ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med to be ſuſpicious of the truth of his religion, as if he were voyd of the power of it. What needs all this adoe, might happily PHILEMON thinke, what needes ſo many arguments, ſuch eager preſſing, ſuch importunity? Doe you thinke that I am ſo hard to be entreated? Doe you thinke that I haue
<pb n="295" facs="tcp:257:153"/> ſuch ſmall ſparkes of grace and religion, as that you hope not to preuaile, but as the widdow with the vnrighteous Iudge, by meere importunity, as if no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing could bee had at mine hands, except it were wrung from mee with the multitude and violence of arguments? If you were ſo well perſwaded of mee, as I hoped you were, leſſe vrging would haue ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued. Now PAVL preuents this ſuſpicion, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mooues this obiection in theſe words, the ſumme whereof riſes to this. Doe not conceiue that this my importunity is from any doubt or diſtruſt of thee; I write not thus earneſtly, as fearing thou wilt not regard mee: but on the contrary, becauſe I haue a ſpeciall confidence in thine obedience; yea, I pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſe vnto thee, that my confidence in thee is ſuch, that I dare preſume, that thou wilt doe not onely this which I deſire, but farre more then I haue moo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued thee in.</p>

Euen the moſt for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward may be quickned. Aſſurance of ſpeed ſhould not coole our feruour in our ſuits for GOD. GOD loues not onely obedience, but a cheerefull ſpirit therein. Though we aſſured of mens obedience, yet who knowes what oppoſitions, reluctations and diſcouragements may come from Satan, and a mans owne corrupt heart. How ſeaſonable then in ſuch caſes may ſome motiues be? and how may our warmth heat another? It is no abſurdity in this caſe to put ſpurres to a running horſe. There is a great
<pb n="296" facs="tcp:257:154"/> difference betweene matters of knowledge, and matters of affection. A mans knowledge is not ſo ſubiect to an omiſſion, as good affections to a remiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion. In good affections there be floods and ebbs, ſometimes glowing coales, &amp; ſometimes but warme embers, and therefore there needes a continuall blowing vp of the flame; but a mans knowledge is not ſubiect to ſuch ſudden eclipſes, and it is farre eaſier for a man to keepe his knowledge at the ſame height and pitch, then to keepe his affections at the ſame bent. And yet for matter of knowledge, ſee the care of PETER, 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1. 12. <hi>Wherefore I will not be negligent, to put you alwayes in remembrance of theſe things, though yee know them, and be ſtabliſhed in the preſent truth.</hi> The ſame was alſo the care and mind of IOHN, 1 <hi>Ioh.</hi> 2. 21. <hi>I haue not written vnto you, becauſe yee haue not knowen the truth, but becauſe yee know it.</hi> If this care and diligence be to bee vſed, in putting men in remembrance in matters of know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, heere there is more ſetledneſſe, how much more then in matters of affection, ought this care to be had, where ſuch often damps and eclipſes? Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe yee know it, therefore I write, ſaith the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle: ſo becauſe men doe good duties, ought they to be admoniſhed, to be vrged and called vpon. Mens forwardneſſe to their duties, ſhould not make vs backeward in calling vpon them, to doe the ſame duties. It is no abſurdity to ſtirre vp a liberall man to bounty, a deuout man to prayer, an holy man to mortification. Eſpecially the moſt forward, that is, not hauing attained to that height and perfection
<pb n="297" facs="tcp:257:154"/> required. Neither therefore muſt Miniſters thinke it a tedious worke, nor people an idle worke, to be vrged and preſſed, to the doing of that they already doe.</p>
                     <p>Marke what hath all this while made PAVL. ſo <label type="milestone">

PHILE<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>MONS obedience puts heat and life into PAVL, and makes him earneſt. A man hath but little heart to ſpeake, where hee hath but little hope to ſpeede. When a man feares he ſhall haue but a cold ſuit of it, it chills his affections, and makes him a cold ſui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor. PAVL could hardly haue beene thus earneſt with a NABAL, as he is with PHILEMON. Nothing encou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rages a Miniſter to bee more zealous in preaching, then to haue his people zealous in hearing and obey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing.

But in the meane time, neuer looke at the reaſon of it, nor enquire into the cauſe of it; but lay the whole burden of the complaint vpon the ſhoulders of the Miniſter. Whereas if due enquiry were made, people might draw their breath inward, and finde themſelues faulty and guilty of thoſe things with which the Miniſter is charged. Why doeſt thou complaine of thy Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters coldneſſe, while thine owne frozen heart hath chilled him? why complaineſt thou of his polluted lips, when they are infected with thy pollution? why accuſeſt thou his folly, when the multitude of thine iniquities haue cauſed it? Examine therefore thine owne heart, and try if thou finde not the cauſe of thy Miniſters defects in thy ſelfe. Many a Miniſter would bee better, if hee had a better people, and a good people makes a good Miniſter, as well as a good Miniſter makes a good people. How can ARCHIPPVS but be watchfull in his Miniſtry, when his people ſhall be ſo watchfull as to ſay, <hi>Take heed to thy Miniſtry,</hi> &amp;c. So many faithfull Monitours muſt needes make a faithfull Miniſter. People may thanke their owne diſobedience, if their Miniſters are not as they ſhould be, <hi>Ier.</hi> 3. 14. 15. <hi>O yee diſobe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dient children turne againe,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>And I will giue you Paſtours according to mine owne heart, which ſhall feed you with knowledge and vnderſtanding.</hi> Therefore
<pb n="299" facs="tcp:257:155"/> had they not ſuch Paſtours, becauſe they were <hi>diſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedient children;</hi> and the way to amend their Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters, was firſt to amend themſelues, <hi>Turne againe, and I will giue your Paſtours,</hi> &amp;c. It is not enough to <hi>pray,</hi> but they muſt <hi>turne</hi> alſo to the Lord of the har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueſt, if they would haue painefull labourers. For peoples diſobedience it is, that makes windy, fro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy, and vaine Preachers. See to this purpoſe, <hi>Ier.</hi> 22. 21. 22. <hi>Thou wouldeſt not obey my voyce, the winde ſhall feede thy Paſtours.</hi> And then how ſhall they feede with knowledge and vnderſtanding, when themſelues are fed with winde?</p>
                     <p>See the credit, yea the honour, that conſcience <label type="milestone">

PHILEMONS good conſcience workes PAVLS confidence. It is a great honor, when our carriage is ſo good, as that an honeſt man dare be confident in vs. It is the honour of the vertuous wife, <hi>Prou.</hi> 31. 11. <hi>that the heart of her husband tru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteth in her.</hi> It is no leſſe the honour of a Chriſtian, that a man may truſt and preſume vpon him. Many haue loſt their credit in the world, and what may be the reaſon? Nothing elſe, but their greater loſſe &amp; ſhipwrack of a good conſcience. Credit &amp; a good conſcience are ſhipped both in one bottome. There cannot be a wracke of conſcience, but with the ioynt loſſe of a mans credit. Bee iealous and ſuſpicious of thy ſelfe, when thou ſeeſt an honeſt man ſhy and ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpicious of thee. It is ſuſpicious thy credit is but

                     <p>The property of a gracious and an enlarged <label type="milestone">

It is not ſo illiberally &amp; niggardly diſpoſed, as <note place="margin">A good heart deales not illi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berally and mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chingly with God.</note> to giue GOD no more then his iuſt dues in extremity, but enlarges it ſelfe ſo, as to goe further, then it is ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by expreſſe commandement. There are ſome particulars, for which wee haue not a direct Text, but onely rules in the generall; as how often a man ſhould pray priuately in a day, how much hee is to giue in almes, and ſome other ſuch things of this kinde. Now in this caſe, where there is not ſo ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſe a rule, a good heart will bee ſure to goe rather with the furtheſt, then to come ſhort; and will ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther doe more, then leſſe; <hi>Thou wilt doe more then I ſay.</hi> So <hi>Luk.</hi> 2. 41. not onely IOSEPH, but MARY al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo went vp to <hi>Ieruſalem</hi> euery yeere, at the feaſt of the Paſſouer. Now there was no expreſſe comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dement for MARY to come, for the commande<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment enioyned the males only to appear, &amp; yet MA<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>RY comes to. Her loue and deuotion to the Lords worſhip, was a ſufficient Law. As ſhee in the cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moniall, ſo CHRIST in the morall, did more then
<pb n="301" facs="tcp:257:156"/> the Law required. The Law requires to loue GOD aboue all, and our neighbors as our ſelues. CHRIST did more, hee loued his enemies not onely as him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe, but aboue himſelfe, giuing himſelfe to death for them, which the Law requires not. Such ſhould our free-hearted diſpoſition be in our obedience to GOD. Indeed the Law requires more then wee can doe, wee abhorre workes of ſupererrogation, and we can doe nothing, but GOD hath required it of vs. But yet ſo ſhould we bee affected towards the Lord, as that rather then we would doe leſſe, we would if it were poſſible, euen do more. And for ſuch things which are not directly commanded, to bee ſo farre from hutching and ſhrinking, as rather to goe with the fartheſt, then to doe with the ſhorteſt. So that I may ſay in this caſe, as our Sauiour in another, <hi>Mat.</hi> 6. 40. <hi>If any man will take away thy coat, let him haue thy cloake alſo, and if any man would compell thee to goe a mile, goe with him twaine.</hi> So heere, If GOD require of thee to giue to the poore a penny, giue him twain; if hee require a ſhilling, to the maintenance of the Miniſtry, giue him fiue; if he require of thee to pray twice a day, rather then faile pray thrice a day; if GOD require thee to preach once a Saboth, rather the faile preach twice. So bountifull is a gracious heart, it doth not ſtand articulating with GOD: It will giue him with the moſt, rather then the leaſt meaſuring the ſame meaſure to the Lord, which it hath from the Lord. The Lord giues vnto vs, not onely be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond our deſarts, but beyond our deſires, euen more, and <hi>aboue that which wee are able to aske or</hi>
                        <pb n="302" facs="tcp:257:157"/> 
                        <hi>thinke, Epheſ.</hi> 3. 20. A good heart therefore hates ſo baſe and illiberall a requitall, as to returne, though a ſhort, yet not a ſhortned meaſure of obedience. In this caſe it were good for vs to doe as the Iewes in the keeping of their Saboth, who becauſe they doe not know the preciſe moment in which the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>both beginnes and ends, therefore beginne it an houre the ſooner, and end it an houre the later, and this time they call <hi>additionem de prafano ad ſacrum.</hi> Not to diſpute the lawfulneſſe of their fact in that particular, without queſtion in all doubtfull and vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>determined caſes, it is beſt to doe with the moſt.</p>
                     <p>It ſerues then to checke the baſe niggardize of <label type="milestone">
                           <seg type="milestoneunit">Vſe. </seg>
                        </label> many, in their obedience to GOD. How farre are they from a good and a deuout heart, who are ſo farre from doing more, that they cannot be brought to doe ſo much as GOD requires, who are ſo farre from exceeding in matters doubtfull, that they come groſſely ſhort in matters of euident and ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parant conſequence So farre from doing thoſe things which are onely incluſiuely and implicitely commanded, that they cannot bee brought to doe things expreſſely and plainely commanded. Ill will they goe two miles for GOD, that will not goe one; hardly will they pray oftner then is precizely com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded, that will not pray ſo often. Hardly with ZACCHEVS will they giue halfe their goods to the poore, that ſo hardly part with a cruſt or a fragment. Scarſe, with the widdow, will they throw two mites into the Lords treaſury that wil not throw in one. It is a note alſo worth the reme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>bring, for ſuch perſons
<pb n="303" facs="tcp:257:157"/> that care not how much they haue from, how little they giue to the maintenance of the Miniſtry. A good heart wee ſee would faine (if it were poſſible) doe more then GOD requires. How much more wil it doe more then man requires. Becauſe the law of GOD and man requires maintenance of the Miniſtry from tithes: therefore many, though neuer ſo well able, thinke themſelues freed from maintaining the Miniſtry, becauſe they haue no tithable goods, it may bee themſelues liuing vpon the vſurious tithes of ten in the hundred. Heerin giue they euidence of their hearts vnſoundneſſe, for if a good heart would (if it could) doe more then GOD requires, ſurely it would not keepe it ſelfe within the narrow and ſtraight compaſſe of mans preſcription.</p>

For if PAVL ſhould ſhortly come to PHILEMON, &amp; find how little he had regarded his former ſuit, with what face could PHILEMON looke vpon PAVL, it
<pb n="304" facs="tcp:257:158"/> were enough to eſtrange PAVL from him. And who would not willingly receiue ONE SIMVS, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming as PAVLS harbenger, to prouide him lodging. Though indeede PAVL make him his harbenger, more out of a deſire to procure him welcome, then out of any ſtate or greatneſſe in himſelfe.

If PAVL, an Apoſtle who had the immediate aſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance of Gods ſpirit, ſtood in ſuch neede of their prayers, how much then doe our Miniſters now.

                     <p n="1">1. In regard of the loue, which is due from peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple <note place="margin">And why?</note> to Miniſter.

And CHRIST applying that <hi>Iſa.</hi> 61. 1. to himſelfe, <hi>Luk.</hi> 4. 18. ſhewes thereby his annoynting as a Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet: yea, and this is to bee marked, that the three offices of King, Prieſt and Prophet, though they were in ſome doubled, yet neuer had any one all of them ioyntly but CHRIST, who <hi>was annoynted with the oyle of gladneſſe aboue his fellowes.</hi> MELCHISEDEC was King and Prieſt, SAMVEL was Prieſt and Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet, DAVID was King and Prophet; but onely CHRIST King, Prieſt and Prophet: Hee alone was
<pb n="321" facs="tcp:257:167"/> indeede that annoynted One, at whom all legall vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions poynted. For the better vnderſtanding of this poynt, conſider breefly foure things.</p>
                     <p n="1">1. The <hi>parts</hi> of his <hi>annoynting.</hi> They are two. Firſt his <hi>conſecration,</hi> whereby hee was ſet a part to doe the office of a Mediatour betweene God and Man. For as the Prieſt vnder the Law, <hi>Exod.</hi> 30. 30. when he was annoynted, was thereby ſeparate and ſet apart for the office of the Preiſt-hood, and <hi>conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crated</hi> vnto that function. So Chriſts annoynting conſiſts firſt in this, in being from all eternity ſet a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>part to be a Mediatour between God and man, and the King, Prieſt and Prophet of his Church. Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly, the <hi>effuſion</hi> or powring forth the fulneſſe of Gods ſpirit and grace, into his man-hood. And therefore <hi>Iſa.</hi> 61. 1. and <hi>Acts</hi> 10. hee is ſayd to bee annoynted with the Holy Ghoſt. Wherein Chriſts annoynting excells the annoyntings of all Kings, Prieſts &amp; Prophets, inaſmuch as the oyle wherwith he was annoynted, was the ſpirit of God it ſelfe.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. The <hi>obiect</hi> of this annoynting. The <hi>obiect</hi> or ſubiect is the whole perſon of Chriſt, God and man. He was annoynted in both natures: for hee was an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noynted as Mediatour, now he is Mediatour, not as man onely, but in both natures, and therefore in both natures annoynted. But this muſt rightly bee vnderſtood. Hee was annoynted in the God<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>head, onely in regard of the firſt part, which was <hi>Conſecration,</hi> by which hee was deſigned to be Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diatour.</p>
                     <p n="3">3. The <hi>manner</hi> or <hi>meaſure</hi> of his annoynting. That
<pb n="322" facs="tcp:257:168"/> we finde <hi>Ioh.</hi> 3. 34. <hi>Hee hath not receiued the ſpirit by meaſure,</hi> that is, hee hath receiued the ſpirit of GOD in a wonderfull, extraordinary meaſure. Indeede we all receiue the Spirit in meaſure, <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 4. 7. <hi>But vnto euery one of vs is giuen grace according to the meaſure of the gift of Chriſt.</hi> But his meaſure was a meaſure well heaped and thruſt, euen ſo great a mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure, as a finite nature was capable of. Therefore <hi>Pſal.</hi> 45. 7. Thy GOD hath annoynted thee with the oyle of gladneſſe <hi>aboue thy fellowes.</hi> More grace hath he then all others, yea all that others haue, they haue from him, <hi>for of his</hi> fulneſſe <hi>wee all receiue.</hi> Yet was not this meaſure infinite, for the man-hood is finite.</p>
                     <p n="4">4. The benefits wee haue by his being CHRIST, that is, <hi>Annoynted.</hi> They are theſe three.</p>
                     <p n="1">1. Wee are heereby made Kings and Preiſts, <hi>Reuel.</hi> 1. 6.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. Wee by his annoynting, are alſo annoynted with the gifts of GODS ſpirit, 1 <hi>Ioh.</hi> 2. 27. and hence GODS Saints are called GODS <hi>annoynted, Pſal.</hi> 105. 15. and wee called <hi>Chriſtians</hi> from CHRIST. And if CHRIST had not beene annoynted, neither ſhould we. For the oyle that was powred on AA<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>RONS head, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 133. 2. ranne downe vpon his beard, and the border of his garments, but yet firſt vpon his head, and then to the garments. So wee are annoynted, but our head firſt, and ſo this oyle of grace runnes downe from the head vnto all the parts of this myſticall body.</p>
                     <p n="3">3. Hereby GOD ſmells a ſweet ſauor of reſt in all
<pb n="323" facs="tcp:257:168"/> our ſacrifices, duties and ſeruices. CHRIST being annoynted with that ſweet oyle, and wee being in him are a ſweet ſauor vnto the Lord, yea hence haue our prayers their ſweetneſſe. Whatſoeuer touched any thing that was annoynted with the holy oyle, was holy. <hi>Exod.</hi> 30. 29. yea. the altar of incenſe was annoynted with holy oyle. CHRIST is that <hi>an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noynted</hi> altar, our incenſe, our prayers layd and offe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red thereon, thereby come to be ſweet and holy.</p>
                     <p>By this mayeſt thou try whether CHRIST be in <label type="milestone">
                           <seg type="milestoneunit">Vſe </seg>1</label> thee or no. Hee is Annoynted, and the ſweet oyle powred out vpon him, if hee bee in thee, thou ſhalt know it by the ſweetneſſe of the oyntment. When the box of oyntment was broken vpon CHRISTS feet, the ſauour thereof filled the whole houſe. How can I then beleeue that CHRIST is in that heart, where are nothing but the dunghilly ſauours of the world, the naſty ſauours of rottenneſſe and corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and the vile ſtench of carnall thoughts.</p>
                     <p>This ſweet oyntment ſhould draw our affections to him, <hi>Cant.</hi> 1. 2. They are wiſe and bleſſed virgins <label type="milestone">

                  <p>
                     <seg rend="decorInit">A</seg>FTER that the Prophet had pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferred his complaint to the Lord againſt the aduerſaries of the Church, from the firſt verſe to the eighth, hee leaueth God, and in a ſudden conuerſion of ſpeech, turnes himſelfe from the party complained vnto, to the parties complained of, the cruell oppreſſours of the Church, terrifying them by thoſe iuſt iudgements of God, which in fine muſt ouertake them, and ſo conſequently chee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring and comforting the diſtreſſed Church. But be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe the diſtreſſe of the Churches enemies, of it ſelfe could be no ſufficient matter of comfort vnto
<pb n="328" facs="tcp:257:171"/> her, therefore a ſecond argument of further, and that farre more effectuall conſolation, is added in this twelfth verſe drawen from the happy condition of the Church, euen whileſt ſhe is thus ouerborne with theſe tygerly and tyrannicall perſecutours. And the argument is propounded by the Prophet, not dire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cting his ſpeech to the Church, but rather in his own perſon bringing in the Church ſuddenly turning her ſpeech from her enemies, with whom ſhe was expo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtulating, to God himſelfe, and breaking forth into this patheticall exclamation, <hi>Bleſſed is the man whom thou chaſtizeſt, ô Lord,</hi> and <hi>teacheſt in thy Law.</hi> From the coherence of which words with the former, we may obſerue,</p>
                  <p>That the outward miſeries of our enemies is but <label type="milestone">
                        <seg type="milestoneunit">Doct. </seg>1</label> colde comfort, vnleſſe withall we haue a perſwaſion of our owne inward happineſſe. The practiſe of the world is to reioyce at the euills of thoſe that haue done euill to them. Comforting themſelues for all the euill they haue ſuſtained at their hands, with that recompence of the like, or greater euills which diuine Iuſtice maketh. But this reioycing is not good: for alas what good can another mans miſery doe vs, when our owne conſciences ſhall tell vs, that we are euery way as miſerable our ſelues. It would doe the childe little good to ſee the rod caſt into the fire, if he himſelfe ſhould be caſt in after it. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Church hauing in this place meditated of the iuſt iudgements of God, which ſhould in due time befall her aduerſaries, and not finding ſufficien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy of comfort therein, heere in this verſe proceedeth
<pb n="329" facs="tcp:257:171"/> to a further meditation of her owne caſe and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition. Wherein ſhe ſeemeth thus to reaſon with her ſelfe. What though theſe mine enemies ſhall at length be brought to their deſerued ends? what though I know they be reſerued for ſhame, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſion? what eaſe can this bring to my minde now deiected, and caſt downe in it ſelfe, and happily thinking it ſelfe as miſerable as theſe my foes? now theſe doubtful thoughts ſomething diſquieting her, further comfort is miniſtred vnto her by the Spirit of God in this verſe, whereby ſhe is enabled to an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwere that obiection ſhee made againſt her ſelfe, namely, that ſhe is aſſured, that as her aduerſaries caſe is wretched ſo is her owne moſt happy and bleſſed. Let no man then reſt in that comfort which the ruine of his and Gods enimies miniſtreth vnto him, but rather in that which his owne conſcience aſſuring him of happineſſe affordeth vnto him, that ſo (to vſe the words of the Apoſtle <hi>Gal.</hi> 6. 4. though in ſomething a diuers ſenſe) he may haue reioycing in himſelfe and not in another. Yet I deny not but great comfort may be taken out of the confuſion of the Churches wicked enemies. <hi>The righteous ſhall reioyce when he ſeeth the vengeance, hee ſhall waſh his feete in the bloud of the wicked, Pſal.</hi> 58. 10. But yet this ioy which ariſes from the ſeeing of Gods iuſtice executed vpon others, as it is nothing ſo full, and ſo perfect as that which proceedeth from the feeling of his mercy in our ſelues, becauſe it is ſomething curbed with griefe, in ſeeing the deſtruction of our owne fleſh; ſo neither of it ſelfe without this latter
<pb n="330" facs="tcp:257:172"/> is it any thing ſound, or ſincere, as not being able to vphold and ſuſtaine the wearied, and feeble knees of our fainting ſoules. Therefore it followes in the eleuenth verſe of that former Pſalme, <hi>So that a man ſhall ſay, verily there is a reward for the righteous, ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily there is a God that iudgeth in the earth.</hi> The righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous could not ſo heartily, and ſincerely reioyce if there were not a reward for him, as well as venge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance for the wicked.</p>
                  <p>Againe, it is worth our obſeruation to conſider <label type="milestone">
                        <seg type="milestoneunit">Doct. </seg>2</label> the manner, wherein this ſecond argument of com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort is propounded. The Prophet doth not turne his ſpeech to the afflicted Church, and ſpeake to her, but he turnes his ſpeech to the Lord ſaying, <hi>Bleſſed is the man whom thou chaſtiſeſt, ô Lord.</hi> What may be the reaſon of this? Did the Lord ſtand in neede of his comfort? why doth he not rather di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rect, and addreſſe his ſpeech to his owne ſoule, and the reſt of his brethren, and fellowes in affliction to whom this comfort belonged? Surely hereby to teach vs, That comfort is then moſt ſweetely and ſenſibly felt and apprehended, when we lift vp our hearts in holy meditations to him who is the Father of mercies, and God of all conſolation. Otherwiſe though arguments of neuer ſo great comfort offer themſelues vnto vs, yet hardly ſhall wee ſtay, and quiet our troubled mindes by them, vnleſſe in think<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing on them, we doe withall thinke on God, break<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing our mindes to him in prayer, and meditation, and familiarly communicating vnto him; what bee thoſe points of comfort wee haue thought vpon.
<pb n="331" facs="tcp:257:172"/> Haue we therefore in our afflictions furniſhed, and fortified our hearts with arguments of conſolation, and meditations of comfort out of the word? let vs poure them forth into the Lords boſome in prayer, and then wee ſhall feele the ſweetneſſe of them in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed, then ſhall wee finde our former comforts doubled, and tripled vpon vs, euen as the beames of the ſunne receiue an increaſe of heate by reflexion. It being the Lords vſuall manner in this holy exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſe of prayer, and comming with him to ſhed a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>broad his loue abundantly into the hearts of his children, thereby reuiuing, and raiſing vp their dead and deiected ſpirits, which <hi>Paul</hi> right well knowing hauing commanded vs to reioyce, and that euer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>more euen in our afflictions, 1 <hi>Theſſ.</hi> 5. 16. 17. ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth immediately a commaundement of praying continually as the onely ſpeciall, and ſoueraigne meanes whereby ſound ioy, and comfort is carried, and conueied into the ſoule of man. Would wee then reioyce, and refreſh our ſpirits caſt downe, and lift them vp againe with conſolatory meditations? See then that thou remember the Apoſtles rule to pray continually, and in prayer to acquaint God with thoſe thy meditations, prayer being that which wringeth, and preſſeth out that ſweet iuyce, and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious liquor of that heauenly comfort which is contained in them. They be the ſighes of the Spirit in prayer, that fetch out the comforts of the Spirit in the word. And to them onely, and to no other are the doctrines of the word comfortable in affli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, who in prayer can vtter them to the Lord
<pb n="332" facs="tcp:257:173"/> with the ſame ſpirit wherewithall the Holy Ghoſts Secretaries wrote them. And this is the reaſon that many learned men which know the comforts of the word yet reape no benefit by them, becauſe they want the Spirit of Prayer to vtter them. This one meditation of the bleſſedneſſe of the man chaſtiſed, and taught by God, yeeldes comfort onely to him, who with this holy Prophet can in the apprehenſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of this meditation aduance his heart to God, and ſay, <hi>Bleſſed is the man whom thou chaſtizeſt O Lord, &amp;c.</hi> And ſurely good reaſon is there if wee rightly conſider of it, that matter of comfort con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiued in our harts ſhould be vttered in prayer vnto the Lord. For whence was it that any matter of comfort came into thy minde? Was it not of God who hath this as part of his ſtyle to be the God of comfort? was it not he that poured thoſe comforts into thy ſoule? good reaſon then thou ſhouldeſt a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine poure them forth into his boſome, and returne them backe to him that is the Father, and fountaine of them. And in truth ſuch is the nature of ſpiritu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all comfort that being ſhed into our hearts it ſo en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larges, and dilates them that it makes them to poure forth themſelues in prayer vnto the Lord. The ſweete comfortable rayes of this ſunne when once they haue lighted vpon our hearts by our reading, and meditating in the word doe forthwith againe rebound, and reflect backe vpon God from whom they came, by our earneſt, and feruent prayers ſent vp to him. And therefore no ſooner could the Lord miniſter an anſwere to the obiection which roſe in
<pb n="333" facs="tcp:257:173"/> the Prophets minde out of his former argument of conſolation, but the Prophet forthwith as ye ſee re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turnes this anſwere to the Author thereof, therein giuing him the glory of that comfort which hee reaped by it, ſaying, <hi>Bleſſed is the man, &amp;c.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>So much of the ſcope and coherence of the text. The words themſelues containe an <hi>attribution</hi> of bleſſednes to the man chaſtiſed of God, and taught by him in his Law. In the man therefore, here pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounced bleſſed, two things are propounded: 1. He is one of <hi>Gods chaſtiſed:</hi> 2. He is one of <hi>Gods taught.</hi> And here for the right vnderſtanding of the words, wee muſt remember that bleſſedneſſe is giuen in both theſe reſpects ioyntly together, and not ſeuerally in regard of each. The Prophets meaning is not, that he who is chaſtiſed of God, is bleſſed; and ſo alſo, he that is taught of God; but that he in whom both theſe meete together to bee both chaſtiſed, and taught of God, that ſuch an one is bleſſed. In the handling of the words I will ſpeak of theſe two points.</p>

                  <p n="1">1. <hi>He is chaſtiſed of God.</hi> Here it may ſeeme ſtrange, that the Prophet ſpeaking of afflictions which came by wicked men vnto the Church, as ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peares by the former part of the Pſalme, ſhould yet aſcribe them vnto God. But wee muſt know that
<pb n="334" facs="tcp:257:174"/> it is not the Prophets meaning hereby any thing at all to excuſe the wicked Perſecutors, who beſides the euill of puniſhment in correcting the Church, which is Gods iuſt, and holy worke, are to bee char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged with the euill of ſinne, in that they do this work of God blindly, and ignorantly, propounding to themſelues the ſatisfying of their owne malicious, and ſpightfull affections, as the onely end of that they doe, and no ſuch thing as God intendeth. What then?</p>

And yet we know that many, if not moſt euills are done by ſome bad men, or other. But for all that God wil haue all acknowledged, as his own doing.

                  <p>The Lords hand in the puniſhment inflicted on his by euill ones, ſhewes it ſelfe in theſe three actions:</p>
                  <p n="1">1. From all eternities he did appoint them, Act. 4. 28. to doe <hi>whatſoeuer thine hand, and counſell hath appointed to be done.</hi>

Sam. 16. 10. As in that perſecution of the tongue, ſo likewiſe in the perſecution of the hand it may bee ſaid, The Lord hath commaunded Tyrants to impriſon, to impoueriſh, to beate, to baniſh, and to behead his children. And therefore as noble men condemned to die, do patiently ſuffer the ſtroake of death at the hands of the baſe Executioner, therein ſhewing their ſubiection, and obedience to their Prince, ſo muſt we patiently, and meekly endure all the indig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nities, and iniuries of wicked worldly men, therein giuing teſtimonie of our obedience to God, who vſeth them as inſtruments of his iuſtice to correct vs. In corrections comming immediately from
<pb n="336" facs="tcp:257:175"/> Gods hand we are not ordinarily ſo impatient, as in thoſe which come by means of wicked inſtruments. The reaſon is, becauſe in theſe latter, we caſt our eye too much vpon the malice, hatred, and ſpight of the inſtruments, and cannot therein behold the Lords holy hand ſtriking vs with theſe rods. But if we would conſider that it is God that ſcourges vs by them, we ſhould then be aſhamed of our fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, in being angrie at the rod without any regard of the Smiter, in ſnarling like dogs at the ſtone, neuer looking at the flinger. Yea wee ſhould then frame our ſelues to greater patience, putting our mouth in the duſt, and giuing our cheeke to him that ſmites vs, becauſe it is the Lords doing more then his, and though he be vniuſt, vnmercifull, vnfaithfull, and vnkinde, yet God therein is moſt iuſt, mercifull, faithfull, and kinde vnto vs.</p>

And therefore as the rod of it ſelfe can doe nothing any further then the force of the hand vſing it giues ſtrength vnto it, no more can they doe any thing vnto vs, as our Sauiour told <hi>Pilate;</hi> further then it is giuen them from aboue, <hi>Ioh.</hi> 19. A merciful father, though he take a great ſwindging rod into his hands to correct his childe, yet he will not ſpend it wholly vpon his tender childes backe, he will ſtrike but ſoft<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, and ſo will not doe him all the hurt which hee might, vſing the rod to the vttermoſt; when the
<pb n="337" facs="tcp:257:175"/> poore child ſees ſuch a terrible rodde, he might iuſtly be afraid, knew hee not that his louing Father would ſo handle the rodde, that it ſhould doe him no more harme then a ſmaller one would. When God lets looſe vpon vs bloody and boyſterous Tyrants, whoſe throat is an open ſepul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chre, whoſe feet are ſwift to ſhed blood, and whoſe mercies are cruell, this might well diſmay vs, knew we not that God by his ouer-ruling hand did mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derate, and reſtraine them. Otherwiſe, if as their power is the rod, ſo their malice were the hand that had the ordering thereof, there would bee no hoe with them, but they would ſoone make a finall diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>patch, and riddance of Chriſtians from the face of the earth. But ſith God is the hand wherein theſe rods are holden, wee need not to feare the greateſt of them, though liuing rods. For howſoeuer <hi>Dauid,</hi> 1. <hi>Sam.</hi> 24. oppoſe the hand of God, and man, and ſaith, It is better to fall into the hands of God then of man, yet wee muſt know, that euen that vvhich <hi>Dauid</hi> calls the hand of man, is the hand of God. And therefore, although it be better for vs to fall into the hand of God immediatly correcting vs, then mediatly by euill men; as it is better for the child to haue a boxe on the eare with his fathers hand, then to bee ſcourged with a whip, and that God ſhewes more mercy ordinarily in the former kind of correction then in the latter, yet mercy alſo doth hee ſhew vnto vs in the latter, in that hee bri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dles, and curbs, yea oftentimes mollifies, and miti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gates the minds euen of moſt fierie, and furious

See then who is the man that may challenge part in this bleſſednes which is here giuen to the afflicted. Hee who is ſchooled, and nurtured of the Lord by the meane of his affliction, and thereby learnes many godly leſſons which he knew not before. Afflictions in themſelues are tokens of Gods anger, curſes rather then bleſſings; but yet when God by his wonder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full power, drawing light euen out of darknes, ſhall turne them to our good, to the increaſe of grace &amp; ſanctification in vs, then are they vndoubted bad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges of our bleſſednes. Examine thy ſelfe therfore what thine affliction hath taught thee, otherwiſe, if thine affliction finding thee vntaught, ſo likewiſe leaue thee, I debarre thee that bleſſednes which ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pertaines to Gods people in their afflictions. Nay, curſed art both thou and thine affliction too, thine affliction is but a fore-runner of worſer things, like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to befall thee when it departs from thee, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out leauing behind it the ſtampe of this holy lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning in thine heart.</p>
                  <p>But more particularly to handle this teaching here ſpoken of. <hi>Teaching</hi> implyes both a Schoole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maſter, <hi>a Teacher,</hi> inſtructing, and <hi>leſſons taught.</hi> In
<pb n="339" facs="tcp:257:176"/> this <hi>Teaching,</hi> both theſe points are here noted out. And for the firſt, namely, the <hi>Schoolemaſter,</hi> it is two fold: 1. The outward affliction and chaſtifement, <hi>Whom thou chaſtiſeſt, teacheſt,</hi> that is, whom by cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtiſing thou teacheſt. 2. God himſelfe, who is the chiefe, and principall head Schoolemaſter, the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther being but an inferiour, and ſubordinate one, <hi>Whom</hi> thou <hi>teacheſt.</hi> And for the ſecond point, <hi>The leſſons taught,</hi> they are included generally in thoſe words, <hi>In thy Law.</hi> To beginne then with the Schoolemaſters, and firſt with the firſt.</p>
                  <p>The firſt Schoolemaſter is Affliction. A ſharp, <label type="milestone">
                        <seg type="milestoneunit">Doct. </seg>
                     </label> and ſeuere and ſwinging Schoolemaſter indeed, &amp; ſo much the fitter for ſuch ſtout and ſtubborne ſchollers as we are: Who becauſe wee will not be ouercome by faire meanes, muſt needs therfore be dealt withall by foule. For God doth not willingly afflict vs, but being neceſſarily thereunto inforced, by that ſtrength of corruption in vs, which other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe will not be ſubdued. So Phyſicions, and Chi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rurgions are conſtrained to come to cutting, laun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing, and burning, when milder remedies will not preuaile. Let vs therefore hereby take notice of the hardnes of our hearts, the fallow ground whereof cannot be broken vp, but by this ſharpe plough of Affliction. See what dullards and block-heads we are, how ſlowe to vnderſtand ſpirituall things, not able to conceiue of them by the inſtruction of words, vnleſſe they be euen beaten, and driuen into our braines by blowes. So thick, and brawny is that foreskin which is drawne ouer our vncircumciſed
<pb n="340" facs="tcp:257:177"/> eares, and hearts, that no doctrine can enter, vnleſs it be pegged, and hammered, and knocked into vs by the fiſts of this ſowre and crabbed <hi>Schoolemaſter.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The ſecond Schoolemaſter is GOD himſelfe. <label type="milestone">

Let vs therefore pray, that as in the miniſtry of Gods Word, ſo alſo of his works and iudgements, wee may be all <hi>taught of God.</hi> For it is his Spirit that quickneth, and animateth the outward meanes, which otherwiſe are a dead letter. And this is the reaſon that many men haue rather grown worſe by their afflictions, then any thing better; becauſe Gods Spirit hath not gone with the affliction, to put life and ſpirit into it, as <hi>Moſes</hi> obſerued in the Iſraelites, <hi>Deut.</hi> 29. 2, 3, 4. <hi>Yee haue ſeene,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>all that the Lord hath done before your eyes in the Land of Egypt, the great tentations which thine eyes haue ſeene, &amp;c. Yet the Lord hath not giuen you a heart to perceiue, and eyes to ſee, and eares to heare vnto this day.</hi> And <hi>Dauid</hi> complaines alſo of them, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 106. 7. <hi>Our Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers vnderſtood not thy wonders in Egypt.</hi> They ſaw them, but vnderſtood them not, becauſe God gaue them not an vnderſtanding heart.</p>
                  <p>The ſecond point is, <hi>The leſsons taught</hi> this bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed man by the two former Schoolemaſters, <hi>Whom thou teacheſt:</hi> What? <hi>In thy Law.</hi>

                     </label> or God by afflictions teacheth his children: euen the ſelfe ſame thing which he teacheth in his
<pb n="341" facs="tcp:257:177"/> Word: as the Schoolemaſter teacheth his ſchol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ler the ſame thing by the rod, which hee teacheth by words. The Word then is the ſtorehouſe of all inſtruction. Looke not for any new diuers doctrine to be taught thee by affliction, which is not in the word. For in truth, herein ſtands our teaching by affliction, that it fits &amp; prepares vs for the Word, by breaking &amp; ſubduing the ſtubbornneſſe of our hearts, and making them plyable, and capable of the impreſſion of the Word. Wherefore, as the Apoſtle ſaith, that the Lawe is our Schoolmaſter to Chriſt, <hi>Gala.</hi> 3. becauſe the Law by ſhewing vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to vs our diſeaſe, forceth vs to the Phyſician. So likewiſe it may be ſaid, that afflictions are School<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maſters to the Law. For whilſt we are at eaſe, and in proſperity, though the ſonnes of thunder terrifie vs neuer ſo much, with the fearefull cracks of legall menaces, yet are we as deafe men, nothing moued therewith. But when we are humbled, and meeke<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned by affliction, then is there way made for the terrors of the Law, then doe wee begin with ſome reuerence of attention to liſten, and giue eare vnto them. When therefore God ſends vs any afflicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, we muſt know that then he ſends vs to the Law and to the Teſtimony. For he teacheth vs indeed in our affliction, but it is in his Law. And therfore if in our affliction we wil learne any thing, we muſt take Gods booke into our hands, and carefully &amp; ſeriouſly peruſe it. And hereby ſhall it appeare, that our afflictions haue been our Teachers, if by them wee haue felt our ſelues ſtirred vp to greater
<pb n="342" facs="tcp:257:178"/> diligence, zeale, and reuerence in reading, and hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring the Word.</p>
                  <p>Wee ſee then the generall leſſon which afflicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on teacheth; namely, that which is in the Law.</p>
                  <p>But this generall, comprehends within his large circuite many ſpecialls worth the knowing. In ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciall therefore, to conſider of the particular leſſons which affliction teacheth thoſe whom it maketh bleſſed, wee muſt knowe that they are very many. They may be reduced to two heads, according to the ſorts of the ſchollers that learne: which being <note place="margin">
                        <hi>Afflictions leſſons</hi> 2.</note> of two kinds, either ſuch as are to be conuerted, or ſuch as are already conuerted, anſwerably are the leſſons taught, ſome for the one ſort, ſome for the other.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. For the firſt ſort, Thoſe who are yet <hi>to bee conuerted.</hi> They by their afflictions are taught this <note place="margin">1 <hi>To the vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conuerted.</hi>
                     </note> one worthy leſſon, worth all the leſſons in the world; namely, to conuert &amp; turne to the Lord, to repent and belieue the Goſpell. This affliction tea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cheth vs not of it ſelfe, for of it ſelfe it teacheth vs rather averſion from God, then conuerſion vnto God: of it ſelfe, it rather driues vs further fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, then drawes vs neerer vnto Chriſt. But onely by acci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent, and occaſionally, euen as the Law ſhewes vs Chriſt, which of it ſelf ſhewes vs nothing but dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation. For in this very point, as in many others, affliction is the Deputy and Vicar of the Law, wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king with vs in the ſelfe ſame manner. For it is that hammer that breakes our rocky hearts, and makes them to ſee, and feele euen by our own experience,
<pb n="343" facs="tcp:257:178"/> how vile and miſerable we are: and ſo when we are, thus brought to the ſight of our own miſery by ſin. God, who can draw forth water euen out of the rock, takes occaſion thereby to ſtir vp in our hearts, a ſerious conſideration of, and an earneſt deſire after that remedy of our miſery, which is pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounded in the Word.</p>
                  <p>This leſſon did <hi>Manaſſes</hi> learne in the ſchoole of affliction, being before a very monſter of men. The priſon was a meanes of his ſpirituall enlargement. The bolts of iron wherwithall he was faſt fettered, and deteyned vnder the power of his aduerſaries, vnloſed the bonds and fetters of ſinne, wherewith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all he was held captiue vnder the dominion of Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tan. Thus was it alſo with the Iaylor, <hi>Act.</hi> 16. vnto whom the danger of his outward man, was a hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py meanes of the ſafety, and ſaluation, both of his outward and inward man. The ſword wherewith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all he would haue thruſt himſelfe thorough, vvas that which whetted, and ſharpned the ſword of the Spirit to enter piercingly, and deeply into his heart and conſcience. A ſcholler of the ſame forme was <hi>Paul, Act,</hi> 9. who when he was vnhorſed by Chriſt, and ſtriken downe to the ground, and ſmitten with blindneſſe, then, euen by meanes hereof, was ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tually lift vp, to the high dignity of a ſonne, and ſeruant of God. His bodily blindneſſe opened the eyes of his mind, and made him in meekneſſe of ſpirit to humble himſelfe vnder his hands, whom he was perſecuting, and to ſay, <hi>Lord, what wilt thou haue me to doe?</hi> It were to be wiſhed that afflictions
<pb n="344" facs="tcp:257:179"/> might finde ſuch happy ſchollers now a dayes a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt vs, that <hi>by them our eares,</hi> as <hi>Iob</hi> ſpeakes, <hi>being opened to diſcipline,</hi> being before vncircumciſed, and ſhut vp, we might iuſtly ſay with <hi>Paul,</hi> 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 11. that we are iudged heere, that we ſhould not be iud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged heereafter. Then might wee ſafely aſſume to our ſelues the bleſſedneſſe heere ſpoken of, when being chaſtized wee haue alſo beene taught of the Lord, to abhorre our former ſinfull wicked courſes, and in truth of heart to turne vnto the Lord. But it is farre otherwiſe, mens hearts are like the Smiths ſtith, the more God ſtrikes them with his iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments the harder they are, like to thoſe Iewes <hi>Amos</hi> complains of in his fourth chapter: I haue ſent theſe and theſe iudgements, as peſtilence, famine, ſword, <hi>yet haue not turned vnto mee.</hi> And <hi>why ſhould yee bee ſmitten any more, ſince yee fall away more and more. Iſay</hi> 1. 5. Such Non-Proficients are our vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conuerted ones in this ſchoole of affliction. For he that profiteth in this inferiour ſchoole ſtayes not long here, but is preſently ſent to an higher ſchoole, euen the ſchoole of Chriſt himſelfe. And then, oh thou wicked wretch, ſhalt thou ſhew thy ſelfe a good ſcholler of thine affliction, when by it thou art made a Diſciple of Chriſt. For this is all this Vſher teaches thee, to enter into the ſchoole of the Arch-Teacher IESVS CHRIST. Then there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore haſt thou learned thy leſſon, and ſo become one of thoſe happy ones of our Prophet heere, when thou art but lifting thy foot ouer the threſhold of Chriſts ſchoole, bringing with thee a minde deſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous
<pb n="345" facs="tcp:257:179"/> to learne, ready to deny it ſelfe, tractable and teachable, ſaying with <hi>Paul, Lord, what wouldeſt thou haue me to doe?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>And thus haue wee learned what is the leſſon of affliction to the vnconuerted.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. The ſecond kind of leſſons taught by afflic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, <note place="margin">2. <hi>To the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerted.</hi> 2.</note> is to thoſe already conuerted. And theſe leſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons are of two ſorts.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. Concerning the right manner of bearing affliction.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Concerning the right profit, and holy vſe of afflictions. Theſe leſſons are proper to the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerted, it beeing impoſſible for a man vnconuerted to leaue either of them.</p>

                  <p>Now concerning the right manner of ſuffering, the Lord teacheth two leſſons to his children, and that euen by meanes of their afflictions.</p>

<pb n="346" facs="tcp:257:180"/> 
                     <hi>The iuſt man ſhall liue</hi> (euen in the midſt of thoſe troubles) <hi>by his faith.</hi> And here the ſpeciall worke of our faith, is to ſtriue and ſtruggle with doubts a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſing from infidelitie, which we doe, when with <hi>Iob</hi> we cry out, <hi>Lord, though thou kill mee, yet will I truſt in thee, Iob.</hi> 13. 15. And with the poore man in the Goſpell, <hi>Lord, I belieue, help my vnbeliefe.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="2">2. That they ſuffer them in obedience, in ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitting <note place="margin">2. <hi>In obedience.</hi> 2.</note> their wills to the will of God. 1.

Now God will account of vs, as of patient ſuffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rers,
<pb n="347" facs="tcp:257:180"/> if finding impatiency to ariſe in our affections, we ſhall be diſpleaſed with our ſelues for it, ſaying with <hi>Dauid, Pſal.</hi> 62. <hi>Yet my ſoule be ſilent to Iehouah.</hi>

For the obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence that God requires and loues, muſt bee cheere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full. Therefore the commandement of ſuffering ſayes, <hi>Let him take vp his croſſe,</hi> which phraſe argues cheerefulneſſe. He muſt not let it lie onely on his backe, being layd on; which argues patience: but he muſt euen himſelfe ſtoope, and take it vp, which implyeth willingneſſe. This cheerefulneſſe recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueth a ſpeciall encreaſe in thoſe afflictions which wee ſuffer for the truths ſake at the hands of euill men, whereupon the Apoſtles reioyced in their ſcourgings. Yet this cheerefulneſſe is not ſo to be found in any, as that hee ſhall not meet with many ſore fits of dumpiſh heauineſſe, but as before it was faith to encounter with infidelity, it was pati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence to wreſtle with impatiency, ſo likewiſe heere it is cheerefulneſſe, with the Prophet <hi>Dauid,</hi> to chide and checke our ſoules for our vncheereful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 42. 5. <hi>Why art thou caſt downe within mee, O my ſoule.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Thus much of the leſſons touching the right manner of ſuffering: now come we to thoſe, which are concerning the right vſe of affliction.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. The ſecond kinde of leſſons, which affliction teaches the Conuerted, is in making an holy vſe <note place="margin">2. <hi>Right profi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting.</hi> 2.</note>
                     <pb n="348" facs="tcp:257:181"/> of their afflictions. And this vſe of our afflictions is either in regard of <hi>knowledge</hi> or <hi>practice.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="1">1. For knowledge: By affliction wee learne a <note place="margin">1. <hi>Knowledge.</hi> 2.</note> two-fold knowledge.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. Wee come by affliction to haue knowledge <note place="margin">1. <hi>Of corruption.</hi>
                     </note> of our <hi>corruption,</hi> and a very cleere ſight of our weakeneſſe and infirmitie, becauſe then there is matter for our corruption to worke vpon. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, howſoeuer before it lay hid, and couched in the heart, and ſo vndiſcerned of vs, yet beeing pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uoked, and ſtirred vp in vs by affliction, it plainely manifeſts it ſelfe. A glaſſe of water being ſhaken, many motes aſcend, and appeare, which before were not ſeene. A man would hardly belieue that there were ſo much infidelity, impatience, techines, frowardnes, rebellion, faint-heartednes, loue of the world, and many ſuch like corruptions in him, as he ſhall find and feele in himſelfe in the day of his affliction. We then, who in the day of our proſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritie thought our ſelues, by reaſon of the pride, and deceitfulneſſe of our hearts, goodly and glorious Chriſtians, ſtrong in faith, of great meekeneſſe and patience, able to deny our ſelues, and this world, by that triall which wee haue of our ſelues in afflic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, are taught the cleane contrary. In this regard afflictions are called Tentations, <hi>Iam.</hi> 1. becauſe they try vs what is in vs, and diſcouer, and detect the cloſe corruption of our hearts. So <hi>Moſes</hi> wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſeth to the Iſraelites, that God humbled them by want in the Deſart to proue them, and to knowe what was in them, <hi>Deut.</hi> 8. 2. Let this then be the
<pb n="349" facs="tcp:257:181"/> firſt leſſon we labour to learne by our afflictions, thereby to take a more through notice of our ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifold corruptions, that ſo we may learne to abate that high conceit of our ſtrength, remembring <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lomons</hi> Prouerbe, If thou faint in the day of aduer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitie, thy ſtrength is but ſmall, <hi>Prou.</hi> 24. 10.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Wee come by affliction alſo to an experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentall <note place="margin">2. <hi>Of Grace.</hi>
                     </note> knowledge of that meaſure of ſpirituall grace which is begunne in vs. For this is the time wherein Grace ſhall be euen forced to ſhew it ſelfe in vs, if there be any: for our corruption exaſpera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted by the affliction, beginnes to worke preſently. And then if there be grace in vs, contrary to this corruption, (as alwaies one contrary is prouoked by another) it will be alſo exaſperated by the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trarietie of corruption, to oppoſe and encounter it. There is no time for the Martialiſt to ſhew his va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour, but in the time of vvarre. The time of afflic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion therefore, being the time of the ſpirituall war, and conflict betwixt the fleſh and ſpirit, then que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtionleſſe, howſoeuer before the ſpirit lay aſleep in vs, yet then he will awaken, and ſtirre vp himſelfe, and declare his mighty power, and puiſſance in vs. Hence it is that afflictions, by <hi>Peter,</hi> are called <hi>the triall of our faith,</hi> 1. <hi>Pet.</hi> 1. 7. And as they are the triall of our faith: ſo of our patience, hope, obedience, courage, conſtancie, &amp;c. Therefore, <hi>Rom.</hi> 5. 3. <hi>Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flictions</hi> are ſaid to <hi>bring forth patience:</hi> becauſe by them, this grace of Gods Spirit is ſtirred vp in his children, and in their afflictions they haue experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence of their patience. Afflictions, in themſelues
<pb n="350" facs="tcp:257:182"/> bring forth impatience, and by this impatience of the fleſh, the patience of the ſpirit is excited. Our Sauiour is ſaid, <hi>Heb.</hi> 5. <hi>to haue learned obedience by the things which he ſuffered.</hi> How was that? Being before diſobedient, did hee then learne to become obedient? Not ſo: but hee learned it experimen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tally, that is, he had triall of his obedience, which was alwaies in him before, but had not ſo fit an oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion to ſhew it ſelfe till then. So in the ſame ſenſe may it be ſaid, that <hi>Abraham</hi> learned loue by that greeuous affliction of beeing put in feare of loſing <hi>Iſaac.</hi> For ſo God tells him, <hi>Gene.</hi> 22. <hi>Now I knowe that thou loueſt mee.</hi> God knew it before, but the meaning is, that now by manifeſt experience it was made known indeed, that <hi>Abraham</hi> did in truth loue God. Therefore it is ſaid that God tempted <hi>Abraham,</hi> in giuing him that commaundement of ſacrificing his ſonne. By affliction therefore wee come to haue knowledge of that grace to be in vs, which before wee either knew not to be in vs at all, becauſe there is no occaſion for it to ſhew it ſelfe, vnleſſe in affliction: as how can a man ſhew his ſtrength, vnleſſe ſome burthen bee layd vpon his backe; or elſe wee knew not to be in our ſelues in that meaſure, and ſinceritie that it was: becauſe there can be no occaſion of ſo ſound a triall of af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fliction. <hi>Reue.</hi> 13. 9. <hi>Iohn</hi> hauing foretold ſome grie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uous perſecution, he addeth, <hi>Heere is the faith and patience of the Saints.</hi> That is to ſay, Here is matter now for the faith of the Saints to work vpon. Hope is compared to an Anchor, <hi>Heb.</hi> 6. whoſe vſe is ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially
<pb n="351" facs="tcp:257:182"/> in a ſtorme. For though in proſperity we may haue experience of our faith, and hope, and loue to God, yet nothing ſo ſoundly and throughly as in affliction. In proſperity there is place for the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uels obiection, <hi>Doth</hi> Iob <hi>ſerue God for nought?</hi> but in affliction it is taken away, and it appeares plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly that wee loue God, ſerue and obey him, not as mercenaries for our owne profit, but euen for him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe. Againe, though in our proſperitie wee might haue ſome experience of the ſinceritie of our gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, yet not of that great meaſure of them which we haue in affliction. Many of the Martyrs that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they were in queſtion, quaked and trembled, after GOD brought them into the field were em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boldened, and ſtrengthened to ſuffer the moſt ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſite torments their aduerſaries could deuiſe. While the corne ſtands in the field, wee may giue ſome geſſe what it will amount to, but when it is cut downe &amp; threſhed out, the yeeld proues more oftentimes then we could before poſſibly expect. So is it with Chriſts harueſt; till wee bee threſhed with the flayle of aduerſity, we cannot tell what in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſe of corne we ſhall yeeld to our heauenly Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter. So much for the vſe of affliction reſpec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting <hi>Knowledge.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="2">2. For <hi>Practice;</hi> The vſe of affliction in matter <note place="margin">2. <hi>Practice.</hi> 2.</note> of practice, is either in <hi>renuing</hi> graces decayed, or elſe, in <hi>increaſing</hi> theſe decaied graces after we haue afreſh renued them.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. And firſt of all, our afflictions teach vs to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nue, <note place="margin">1. <hi>Renuing gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces decayed.</hi>
                     </note> and take vp afreſh the practice of all Chriſtian
<pb n="352" facs="tcp:257:183"/> duties, which proſperity had cauſed vs to intermit. For oftentimes, the children of God beeing drun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken, and beſotted with eaſe and proſperity, fall in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to dangerous Lethargies, and ſuch dead ſleepes of carnall careleſnes, that they euen forget God, and themſelues. Now by affliction, God comming &amp; giuing them a priuy nip in their fleſh, awakeneth them, and cauſeth them to return again vnto them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues. So that in this reſpect, affliction is to the children of God, as the pricke to the breſt of the Nightingale, whereby ſhe being awakened out of her ſleepe, ſingeth moſt melodiouſly. See how the Apoſtaticall Church of the Iſraelites, pricked with the thornes of affliction, <hi>Hoſea</hi> 2. 7. playes the Nightingale, ſweetly ſinging the ſong of her retur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning againe to the Lord, her firſt husband. So the Prodigall ſonne, feeling the prick of famine, <hi>Luke</hi> 15. hauing been once a member of the Church, a ſonne liuing in the houſe of his Father, and after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards running away, what is it that ſends him home againe, and makes him renue his conuerſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on? The preſent miſery wherewithall hee was pin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched. To this purpoſe excellently ſpeakes <hi>Elihu, Iob</hi> 33. 15, 16. that God in trouble rounds men in the eare, that lye ſecurely ſnorting in their ſinnes, and ſo arouſes them by the noyſe of his voice ſpea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king in affliction. Haue we therefore beeing wiſe Virgins, begun to ſlumber with the fooliſh? haue we left our firſt loue, and decayed in the graces of the Spirit? then ſurely if affliction come vnto vs, the leſſon we are to learne, is to <hi>remember from whom</hi>
                     <pb n="353" facs="tcp:257:183"/> 
                     <hi>we are fallen, to repent, and doe our firſt works,</hi> and to quicken thoſe things that are ready to dye.</p>
                  <p>Now theſe decaying, and languiſhing graces, <note place="margin">
                        <hi>Which are</hi> 2.</note> which affliction calls vpon vs to reuiue, and ſtirre vp afreſh in our ſelues, are either <hi>generall,</hi> and the maine foundation of all the reſt, or elſe <hi>ſpeciall,</hi> de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pending vpon the former.</p>

                     <hi>Faith,</hi> both in regard of Gods prouidence for this temporall life, as alſo of his mercy for the life to come, in the ſaluation of our ſoules.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. For the firſt; wheras in proſperitie we hauing <note place="margin">1. <hi>In Gods pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uidence.</hi>
                     </note> all things according to our hearts deſire, as health, ſtrength, credit, countenance, maintenance, wee did too too much reſt, and rely our ſelues vpon theſe, for the preſeruation of this tranſitory life: now when in affliction God takes from vnder vs theſe proppes, theſe ſtilts, and ſtaues of our confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, then we are conſtrained by faith to fly vnto him, and depend on his good prouidence, <hi>Deut.</hi> 8. 2. <hi>Therefore he humbled thee, and made thee hungry,</hi> that thou mighteſt learne, <hi>that man liueth not by bread, but by euery word that proceeds out of the mouth of God.</hi> This was the leſſon God would teach the Iſraelites by that hunger and want they endured in the Deſart, namely, to call backe their confidence from the outward meanes of life, as bread, and to giue it wholly to Gods prouidence. This leſſon
<pb n="354" facs="tcp:257:184"/> alſo <hi>Paul</hi> confeſſeth that hee was taught by his af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fliction, 2. <hi>Cor.</hi> 1. 9. <hi>We receiued the ſentence of death in our ſelues,</hi> that wee ſhould not truſt in our ſelues, but in GOD <hi>who raiſeth vs from the dead.</hi> We are all like proud beggers, who ſo long as we may haue reliefe at home, will not goe ſeeke abroad: as long as wee haue the outward meanes to ſtay our ſelues on, we will not ſeeke to God. But in affliction God makes vs giue ouer our hold, in the meanes which he takes from vs; and ſo wholly to caſt our ſelues by faith on him. When riches haue taken vnto the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the wings of the Eagle, and are gone fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> vs; when our credit ſhall be cracked, and our honour layd in the duſt; when the precious oyntment of our good name ſhall putrifie; when our deareſt and neereſt friends ſhall deceiue vs as a brooke; in a vvord, when all outward helps and hopes ſhall fayle vs, and we ſhall be left deſtitute, and deſolate, ſtarke naked, and beſtript of all, will not this make vs, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nying all other things, by faith to catch hold on God, houering and couering our ſelues vnder his wing? Yes ſurely: Then ſhall we be forced to ſay, <hi>It is better to truſt in God, then to haue confidence in man, yea, it is better to truſt in God, then to haue confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence in Princes, Pſal.</hi> 118. 8, 9. And with <hi>Iehoſha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phat,</hi> 2. <hi>Chro.</hi> 20. <hi>O Lord, we know not what to doe, but our eyes are toward thee.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="2">2. Neither doth affliction cauſe vs to renue our <note place="margin">2. <hi>In Gods pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe.</hi>
                     </note> faith onely, in depending vpon Gods prouidence for theſe outward things, but alſo in depending on his mercifull promiſes, for the ſaluation of our
<pb n="355" facs="tcp:257:184"/> ſoules. For vnleſſe this latter act of our faith be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nued, it is impoſſible wee ſhould renue the former. In Chriſt onely come wee to haue right to tempo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall mercies; and therefore none can haue faith in God for his preſeruation in this world, that hath not faith in Chriſt for the remiſſion of his ſinnes. Afflictions therefore teaching vs to renue the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer, doe neceſſarily alſo cauſe vs to renue the lat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter. And as in this regard affliction ſtirres vs vp to renue our faith, in beleeuing in Chriſt, ſo alſo in an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other reſpect. When afflictions are come vpon vs, Sathan vſeth to deſcant vpon them, and caſt them in our teeth, as arguments of Gods anger. Herevp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on wee are neceſſarily conſtrained to looke to our aſſurance, to ſearch our euidences, to conſider wel on what ground wee ſtand, and to try our faith to the vttermoſt. Thus <hi>Iob</hi> renued his faith in his af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fliction notably, by examining the ſoundnes of his former faith, and by continuing in it after hee had found it ſound; not caſting away his confidence, but cleauing more forcibly to GOD then before, <hi>Lord, though thou kill me, yet will I truſt in thee, Iob</hi> 13.</p>
                  <p n="2">2.

<pb n="356" facs="tcp:257:185"/> preacheth Gods wrath, &amp; Gods wrath neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily preſuppoſeth ſome ſin. The darknes of afflicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on is a light whereby we find out ſin. When we ſee things goe not well without, wee are enforced to conclude that there is ſome diſorder within, and to ſay with the Church, <hi>Lam.</hi> 3. <hi>Wherefore is the liuing man ſorrowfull? Man ſuffereth for his ſin.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>And hereupon we proceed further, and ſay with the Church in the ſame place, <hi>Let vs ſearch and try our waies;</hi> let vs find out thoſe ſinnes for which we are now rebuked. This is that which <hi>Elihu</hi> plainly teacheth, <hi>Iob.</hi> 36. 8, 9. <hi>And if they be bound in fetters, and tyed with the cords of affliction, then will hee ſhew them their worke, and their ſinnes, becauſe they haue beene proud.</hi> Before theſe cords and fetters came, men would take no notice of their ſinnes, but ſlub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bered them ouer as matters of nothing, ſoothing, and bleſſing themſelues in them: but when God comes with this ſcourge, he makes them enter into their hearts, and ranſack their conſciences, &amp; there to find out their cloſe &amp; ſecret corruptions, which before they ſaw not. This did the grieuous mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tality of the Iſraelites in the Wilderneſſe effect in <hi>Moſes,</hi> and others fearing God. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 90. 8. <hi>Thou ſetteſt our iniquities before thee,</hi> and <hi>our ſecret ſins in the light of thy countenance.</hi> God ſets our iniquities before himſelfe, when he ſets them in order before our owne conſciences. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 50. So was it with <hi>Iob,</hi> by meanes of his affliction poſſeſſing the ſinnes of his youth; with the widdow of Sarepta, who cryed out to the Prophet when her child was dead, <hi>Why</hi>
                     <pb n="357" facs="tcp:257:185"/> 
                     <hi>art thou come to bring my ſins to remembrance?</hi> With <hi>Ioſephs</hi> brethren, whoſe memories beeing rubbed by affliction in Egypt, they came to ſee the gree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uouſnes of that ſin, which for the ſpace of twentie yeeres they had ſuffered to lye vnqueſtioned vpon their conſciences. And thus was it with <hi>Iaacob,</hi> who being made odious in the ſight of his neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours, by the bloody butchery of his ſonnes, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vpon tooke occaſion to ſearch his family, and to find out that ſecret idolatry which for a long time had lyen lurking there. And thus ought it to bee with euery one of vs in the day of our affliction, to harken to the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mandement of the Prophet, <hi>Zeph.</hi> 2. 1. <hi>Sift, ſift your ſelues, O Nation, not worthy to be be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loued.</hi> Enter we into a more ſerious co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſideration of our owne waies, and courſes, that ſo wee hunting, and ferreting out our corruptions out of the cloſe corners of our hearts, we may both ſee thoſe ſinnes which we could not formerly eſpy, and may more cleerely diſcerne thoſe which already haue beene diſcouered vnto vs.</p>

Then with <hi>Iob,</hi> though before iuſtifying our ſelues wee cry out, <hi>Behold, I am vile, and abhor my ſelfe in duſt and aſhes, Iob.</hi> 42. Then, with the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>digall child, though before thinking our ſelues to be too good to be ſonnes, wee iudge our ſelues ſcarce worthy the roome of a ſeruant. Then with <hi>Dauid,</hi> though before bleſſing our ſelues vvith the pompe and pride of our glorious eſtate, we ſaid we ſhould neuer be moued: yet then by experience, ſeeing our former vanitie, we deſpiſe all the glory, and greatnes of this world, ſaying with <hi>Dauid, Pſal.</hi> 39. 11. <hi>When thou with rebukes dooſt chaſtiſe man for iniquity, thou as a moath makeſt his beauty to conſume: ſurely euery man is vanity.</hi>

This humiliation alſo hath affliction alwaies wrought in the hearts of Gods children, <hi>Iere.</hi> 31. 18. <hi>I heard</hi> Ephraim <hi>lamen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting.

                     </note> cariage, both towards God and man. This alſo af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fliction will wring fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> vs: for it will bring vs downe vpon our knees before God, and make vs confeſſe our owne vnworthineſſe, as in <hi>Iob,</hi> the Prodigall, &amp; in <hi>Ephraim, Iere.</hi> 31. 18. confeſſing his owne vnta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mednes with teares. And <hi>Lam.</hi> 3. It makes a man to put his mouth in the duſt. It makes vs alſo to be of
<pb n="359" facs="tcp:257:186"/> an humble and lowly carriage towards men, doing nothing that may ſauour of pride, contempt, or diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>daine, but rather abaſing our ſelues to our inferi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ours, and <hi>Lam.</hi> 3. giuing our cheeks to the ſmiters, and patiently &amp; meekly, without deſire of reuenge, enduring many opprobrious indignities. Hereof we haue a notable example in <hi>Dauid,</hi> who though the King, yet beeing throughly humbled by that grieuous affliction of <hi>Abſaloms</hi> treaſon, moſt quiet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and contentedly ſuffered the baſe peſant <hi>Shimei</hi> to be myre him with the durt of his filthy tongue, reſtraining his ſeruants from reuenge.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. The third act of <hi>Repentance,</hi> which affliction <note place="margin">3. <hi>In vocation.</hi>
                     </note> teacheth vs to renue, is, after that we haue ſeen our ſinnes, and in ſome good meaſure haue been hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled for them, to pray earneſtly, as for life &amp; death, for the pardon of them, and for power ouer them. In proſperity we pray heauily &amp; drowſily, as thogh we had no life, but in our affliction this lazineſſe is ſhaken off. The ſenſe of our preſent miſery, ſets an edge vpon our prayers, puts life and ſpirit into them: yea, it giues wings vnto them, and cauſeth them to aſcend aloft, wheras before they lay groue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling on the ground. Oh! how ſauourly do we pray in affliction? how feelingly, feruently, &amp; forcibly? <hi>Eſay</hi> 26. 16. <hi>Lord, in trouble how they viſited thee? they poured out a prayer when thy chaſtening was vpon them.</hi> So fit and ſeaſonable a time is affliction for prayer: then it flowes from vs, and we can poure it forth; but alas! how droppingly it comes from vs in proſperity? <hi>Iam.</hi> 5. <hi>Is any man afflicted, let him,</hi>
                     <pb n="360" facs="tcp:257:187"/> aboue any other, <hi>pray.</hi> For he moſt of all feeles his wants, and he moſt of all hath the preſence of the Spirit, the onely Schoolemaſter of prayer, to help his infirmities, and to ſtirre vp ſtrong ſighes, and cryes, and groanes vnvtterable, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8. 26.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. The laſt and principall act of our Repentance, <note place="margin">4. <hi>Reformation.</hi>
                     </note> which afflictions call vpon vs for, is reformation of thoſe our ſinnes, for the which after we had found them out by examination, we humbled our ſelues, and prayed earneſtly for the pardon of them. <hi>Iob</hi> 36. 10. <hi>Elihu</hi> hauing ſet downe the firſt act of repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance for ſinnes paſt, namely, the diſcerning of the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> as a fruit of affliction, addeth alſo this laſt of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation as another, <hi>Hee openeth their eares to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipline, and commaundeth them to depart from iniqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie.</hi> So likewiſe <hi>Eſay</hi> 27. 9. <hi>By this,</hi> namely, the af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flictions formerly ſpoken of, <hi>ſhall the iniquity of</hi> Ia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>acob <hi>be purged, and this is all the fruit, the taking a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way of his ſinne.</hi> So then afflictions, when by Gods Spirit they are made powerfull Teachers, they wil not let vs reſt in ſeeing our ſinnes, in humbling our ſelues for them, in praying againſt them: but they will commaund vs, as <hi>Elihu</hi> ſpeakes, to depart from iniquity, to leaue and forſake our ſinnes, &amp; to learn the contrary graces and vertues. This <hi>Dauid</hi> felt in his owne experience, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 119. who before he was afflicted, went aſtray, but hauing been nurtured in this Schoole, acknowledges that it was good for him that he had bin afflicted, <hi>becauſe thereby he had</hi> learned <hi>to keep the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mandements. The blewnes of the wound,</hi> ſaith <hi>Salomon, ſerues to purge out euil. Pr.</hi> 20. 30.
<pb n="361" facs="tcp:257:187"/> when we haue felt the ſmart of ſinne, by our afflic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, then like burnt children will we dread the fire. In this reſpect affliction is compared in Scripture to a Furnace, into which gold being caſt, loſes his droſſe, and comes forth pure, and purged, 1. <hi>Pet.</hi> 1. 9. In proſperity we contract, and gather toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther much ſoyle and droſſe, which the Lord is fayne to driue out of vs by the heate of this ſcor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching fire, that ſo we might be pure, and refined metall for himſelfe, being made <hi>partakers of his holineſſe, Heb.</hi> 12. 10. Therefore <hi>Lam.</hi> 3. are afflicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons compared to a yoake, <hi>It is good for a man to beare the yoake in his youth,</hi> becauſe it tameth, and mortifies our wilde, and vnruly corrupt natures, and makes vs in all things plyable to the will of God. This Purgatory therefore we willingly ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge, the Purgatory of afflictions, whereby God ſcowres, and cleanſes vs from the draffe<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> of many noyſome and vnſauory corruptions; and as it were by a ſtrong Purge, empties, and euacuates thoſe ſuperfluities of malice, enuie, pride, ſecurity, wherewith we were before ſurcharged. Let vs all therefore examine our ſelues in this one point, whether our afflictions haue brought the quiet fruit of righteouſneſſe vnto our ſoules: whether the Ni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter and Fullers ſope thereof hath waſhed out our Leopards ſpots; whether the rawneſſe of our cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupt, and fulſome humours, haue beene taken away after that we were ſodden, and ſoaked in afflictions: For this is the maine vſe of our afflictions. And that which our Sauiour ſaid to the man healed,
<pb n="362" facs="tcp:257:188"/> 
                     <hi>Ioh.</hi> 5. do all our afflictions ſay to vs, both at their comming; as alſo, and that more eſpecially at their departure, and farewell: <hi>Go your wayes, and ſinne no more, leſt worſe things come vnto you.</hi> The want of this fruite is lamentable in many, who, howſoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>euer in the extremity of their affliction, purpoſe, and promiſe; yea, and ſolemnely vow this refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation, yet no ſooner is the hand of God off them, but with the dog comming out of the water, they ſhake their eares; and do againe with the Sow re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turne to the wallowing in the mire.</p>
                  <p>And theſe be the acts of our Repentance in regard of <hi>Sinnes paſt.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="2">2. There is another Act reſpecting ſinnes to <note place="margin">2. <hi>Wiſe preuenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of ſinnes to come.</hi>
                     </note> come, which affliction alſo ſtirreth vp in vs; name<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, care to preuent them: For afflictions, as they ſerue to reforme ſinnes paſt, ſo likewiſe to preuent ſinnes to come. Therefore are they compared to an hedge, <hi>Hoſ.</hi> 2. 6. ſtopping vs in our way that wee can go no further. And this <hi>Paul</hi> ſheweth in his owne example, 2. <hi>Cor.</hi> 12. 7. This was the end why God ſent him the <hi>Thorne</hi> in the fleſh, to preuent pride in him, leſt he ſhould be exalted aboue mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure in the multitude of reuelations. And hence it is that ſo many times in the children of God, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore honour hath gone humility; before ſome great bleſſing, ſome grieuous croſſe; that by this meanes thoſe ſinnes, which through our corruption, proſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perity would haue brought with it, might bee pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uented. If <hi>Dauid</hi> had beene preſently taken from the Sheep-fold to the Throne, hee might haply
<pb n="363" facs="tcp:257:188"/> haue growne inſolent, too forgetfull of God, and his duety in gouernement: Therefore a long time before, did the Lord exerciſe him with many ſore afflictions, that ſo thoſe miſchiefes might be eſca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped. To the ſame purpoſe was <hi>Ioſeph</hi> abaſed in the dungeon, before hee was aduanced to that place of authority. So were the Iſraelites forty yeares wandring in the Deſart; and after that many yeares taken vp with tedious warres, before they obtained the peaceable poſſeſſion of the Land of <hi>Canaan:</hi> and <hi>Moſes</hi> forty yeares an exile, and a keeper of ſheep, before he was the Conductor of the Iſrae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lites to the promiſed Land.</p>
                  <p>So much for the renewing of theſe two maine and <hi>Generall</hi> graces of <hi>Faith</hi> and <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="2">2. Beſides the ſtirring vp of theſe, affliction <note place="margin">2. <hi>Speciall</hi> 4.</note> further awakens in vs many <hi>ſpeciall,</hi> and particular graces; and among them ſpecially foure.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. Our Thankefulneſſe for his mercies, which <note place="margin">1. <hi>Thankfulnes.</hi>
                     </note> we forgat in our proſperity, though daily before our eyes. But by affliction, in the want of them, perceiuing the worth of them, we are ſtirred vp to a more regardfull eſtimation of them; and ſo are wee taught to bee truely thankefull for them when againe we do re-obtaine them. After long ſickneſſe, in the want of health, feeling the ſweet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of health, how ſhal we then relliſh our health, and how thankefully ſhall wee receiue it at Gods hand? So after long impriſonment, how highly then ſhall we appriſe our liberty, more carefully
<pb n="364" facs="tcp:257:189"/> vſing it for Gods glory then euer before.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Compaſſion towards thoſe that are in the <note place="margin">2. <hi>Compaſſion.</hi>
                     </note> ſame, or like affliction: Wee are very cruell, and hard-hearted, by nature, to our brethren in diſtreſſe and miſery: That therefore our hearts may be en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larged towards them, God ſendeth afflictions to vs, that we may haue experience of the ſame mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſery our ſelues. This vſe Chriſt himſelfe made of his afflictions, <hi>Heb.</hi> 4. 15. <hi>We haue not an high Prieſt which cannot be touched with the feeling of our infir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mities, but was in all points tempted like as wee are.</hi> This <hi>Paul</hi> makes plaine, 2. <hi>Cor.</hi> 1. 2, 3, 4, 5, 6.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. Preparation for death, whereof euery afflic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion <note place="margin">3. <hi>Preparation for death.</hi>
                     </note> is a meſſenger or harbinger; and therefore when afflictions come, we haue warning giuen vs of deaths approach, and ſo are iuſtly occaſioned to renew our preparation for the entertainement of him. This vſe the Apoſtle <hi>Paul</hi> made of his afflic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, 1. <hi>Cor.</hi> 15. when by them he <hi>learned to die dai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly.</hi> For beſides that they put vs in minde of our mortaltty, they themſelues, being little kindes of death, make death ſeeme leſſe grieuous vnto vs. If a man would be able to beare a great burthen, hee ſhall be the more able to do it by inuring him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe to beare a leſſe: as <hi>Bilney</hi> prepared himſelfe to the fire of his martyrdome, by the fire of his Candle.</p>

<pb n="365" facs="tcp:257:189"/> me build my Tabernacle heere: God is therefore faine to weane vs from the world, euen as mothers do their children, by laying on ſome ſowre thing which may cauſe vs to diſtaſte it, and ſo being out of loue with it, to cry, <hi>Come, Lord Ieſus.</hi> This vſe <hi>Moſes,</hi> and the reſt of the Iſraelites made of thoſe contagious ſickneſſes which raigned amongſt them in the Deſert, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 90. 12. <hi>Teach vs to number our daies, and to apply our hearts to wiſedome.</hi> All is little enough to make vs thinke of our home. Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer would the Iſraelites haue beene brought to haue ſtirred one foote out of <hi>Egypt,</hi> had they not beene tyred with that ſore bricke bondage, and <hi>Pharaohs</hi> tyrannie; they that in the Deſart wiſhed for the fleſh-pots, and onyons of <hi>Egypt,</hi> notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding their ſore bondage, ſurely but for that bondage, would neuer haue left thoſe fleſhpots.</p>
                  <p>So much of the firſt maine vſe of our afflic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions in regard of practice, the renewing of graces decayed.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. The ſecond followes; namely, an encreaſing <note place="margin">2. <hi>Encreaſing Grace renewed.</hi>
                     </note> in thoſe graces renewed. This vſe of afflictions our Sauiour notes; <hi>Ioh.</hi> 15. 2. <hi>Euery branch that brings forth fruite, my Father purges,</hi> with the pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning knife of afflictions, <hi>That it may bring forth more fruite.</hi> Looke then how Vines pruned, and Trees lopped grow the faſter; ſo the Chriſtian af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flicted, thriues, and proſpers the better in Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>anity: So 2. <hi>Cor.</hi> 4. 16. the decayes of the outward man by afflictions, are the renewings of the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward. The happy <hi>Antiperiſtaſis</hi> of the outward
<pb n="366" facs="tcp:257:190"/> cold of afflictions doth increaſe the inward heate, and feruour of the grace of God in vs. And theſe be the leſſons which God teacheth by correcting of vs. So that now wee may fully ſee the meaning of theſe words, <hi>And teacheſt in thy Law.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Hitherto of the firſt part of this Text, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning thoſe things which are required by the Prophet, in him whom he bleſſeth; namely, that hee bee as corrected of God, ſo alſo taught of God.</p>
                  <p>Come we now to the ſecond part, concerning that bleſſedneſſe which in theſe reſpects belongeth to the childe of God. <hi>Bleſſed is the man.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The doctrine of the Pſalmiſt in this place is a paradoxe to fleſh and bloud, which iudgeth no men more vnhappy then thoſe that are laden with miſeries, ſpecially ſuch as here the Prophet ſpeakes of, which come by meanes of cruell enemies. What bleſſedneſſe would one thinke there were in being trod vnder foote, and trampled vpon like durt by others, our bitter aduerſaries? Well, though the blinde buzzards of this world cannot ſee this; yet the faithfull can, by the quicke and piercing eye of their faith, behold the light of the Sunne, through the thickeſt and darkeſt cloudes. Let vs therfore conſider a little of this <hi>bleſſedneſſe</hi> of thoſe whom God ſchooles by correction, and ſee where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in it conſiſteth.</p>
                  <p>This <hi>bleſſedneſſe</hi> therefore is twofold: <hi>Priua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiue</hi> and <hi>Poſitiue.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="1">1. The firſt kinde of bleſſedneſſe I call <hi>Priua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiue,</hi> becauſe it conſiſteth in taking away of that
<pb n="367" facs="tcp:257:190"/> curſe which naturally cleaues to all afflictions: For as death, ſo alſo all other afflictions haue their ſting, which yet is taken away by the death of Chriſt: So that now to them that are in Chriſt, all afflictions are but droanes, they are vnſtinged by Chriſt; they may buzze, but hurt they cannot, Chriſt hath fully ſatisfied Gods iuſtice, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore no further puniſhment can bee demanded of vs. Therefore our afflictions are now no longer puniſhment, their nature is altered, but onely fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therly corrections, and trials of our faith. And herein conſiſts the firſt part of our bleſſedneſſe in affliction, that we are freed from the curſe and an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger of God, which is neceſſarily annexed to all the afflictions of the vngodly. Whereupon we may now inſult ouer affliction, and ſing triumphantly; Oh affliction, where is thy ſting? And being out of the danger of hurt by it, we may ſecurely laugh at it, as the wilde Aſſe, at the Horſe and the Rider, <hi>Iob.</hi> 5.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. There is alſo a <hi>Poſitiue bleſſedneſſe</hi> in the af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flictions of the godly. There is not onely the ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence of euill from affliction, but good alſo is pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent, in regard whereof the afflicted worthily are called, and counted bleſſed.</p>
                  <p>This preſence of good in our affliction is ſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally in theſe reſpects.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. The good from whence they haue their Ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginall; namely, the loue of God diſpoſing theſe af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flictions to vs: <hi>Heb.</hi> 12. <hi>Whom hee loueth, hee chaſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth.</hi> This loue of God manifeſts it ſelfe ſpecially
<pb n="368" facs="tcp:257:191"/> in theſe two points: The <hi>Meaſure,</hi> and the <hi>Manner</hi> of their afflictions.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. For the <hi>Meaſure:</hi> In this regard haue the godly an happy turne in their afflictions, that wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as the vngodly drinke vp the whole cup of his wrath, dregges and all, the godly do but ſip of it: whereas they are ſcourged with Scorpions, theſe onely are corrected with the rods of men. In this ſenſe, <hi>Hab.</hi> 3. 2. God is ſaid to remember mercy in anger: becauſe in puniſhing his children, hee re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpects their weakeneſſe, not ſuffering them to bee tempted aboue their ſtrength, 1. <hi>Cor.</hi> 10. 13. <hi>It is the Lords mercies that wee are not conſumed, Lam.</hi> 3. 22. Mercy is a curbe to Gods Iuſtice in afflicting his children, and cauſes him to moderate, and miti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gate the puniſhment; and as <hi>Ieremy</hi> ſpeakes, <hi>Ier.</hi> 10. to <hi>correct them in iudgement;</hi> that is, in an holy wiſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome proportioning their affliction according to their ſtrength, and <hi>not in his anger, left he bring them to nothing.</hi> This is that which the Prophet <hi>Eſay</hi> tea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cheth, chap. 27. 7, 8. ſhewing the difference betwixt the afflictions of Gods own people, and ſtrangers: <hi>Hath hee ſmitten him as he ſmote thoſe that ſmote him? or is hee ſlaine according to the ſlaughter of them that are ſlaine by him?</hi> In meaſure <hi>wilt thou contend with him?</hi> This mercifull meaſuring out the portion of our cup, is grounded vpon Gods owne promiſe, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 89. 30, 31. <hi>If his children breake my Law, &amp;c. then will I viſite their tranſgreſsions with the rod, and their iniquity with ſtrokes: But my louing kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe will I not take from him, neither will I falſifie</hi>
                     <pb n="369" facs="tcp:257:191"/> 
                     <hi>my truth.</hi> Here then is another point of our hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſſe in our affliction, that God laies not loade vpon vs, as on the wicked, but ſweetely tempering mercy and iuſtice together, giues vs occaſion to ſay with <hi>Dauid; The Lord hath chaſtened me ſore, but hath not deliuered me to death, Pſal.</hi> 118. 18.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. For the <hi>Manner.</hi> God ſhewes his loue to vs in our afflictions, in the manner of inflicting them vpon vs, in that hee doth it as fathers correct their children, vnwillingly; <hi>Lam.</hi> 3. 33. <hi>For hee doth not afflict willingly, nor grieue the children of men.</hi> Hee doth not take any delight in our paine and mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſery, but being neceſſarily thereunto enforced, out of a fatherly reſpect which hee hath of vs, to doe vs good, and to keepe vs from miſchiefe, 1. <hi>Cor.</hi> 11. <hi>VVhen wee are iudged, wee are chaſtened of the Lord, that we ſhould not be condemned with the world.</hi> Gods bowels doe euen earne ouer our ſoules, when hee comes to correct; <hi>Hoſ.</hi> 11. 8. <hi>How ſhall I giue thee vp, Ephraim? How ſhall I deliuer thee, Iſrael? &amp;c. Mine heart is turned within mee, my bowels are rowled toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther:</hi> See how liuely God ſets forth in himſelfe the affections of a father, that can finde in his heart to beate his childe hauing done a fault.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Reſpect of our bleſſednes, in regard of the Good thereof, is in regard of the good annexed vnto them, &amp; neceſſarily concomitant with them. This Good is three-fold.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. Our conformity with Chriſt our elder bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, who firſt ſuffered, and then entred into glory, who firſt wore a crowne of thornes, &amp; then of glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry;
<pb n="370" facs="tcp:257:192"/> who firſt felt the weight of his burdenſome croſſe, and then that eternall weight of happineſſe, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8. 29. <hi>Thoſe whom he knew before, he predeſtinate to be made like to the image of his Sonne:</hi> that is, in be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing <hi>conſecrated through afflictions,</hi> as he was, <hi>Heb.</hi> 2. 10. Hitherto belongs that of <hi>Paul, Phil.</hi> 3. 10. <hi>That I may know the fellowſhip of his ſufferings, being made conformable vnto his death.</hi> This is one point of our bleſſednes, for the liker Chriſt, the happier ſurely we be.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Our communion with Chriſt, who is a fellow-ſufferer with vs in all our afflictions, vnleſſe ſuch wherein we ſuffer as euill doers, 1. <hi>Pet.</hi> 4. 13. Ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, <hi>Act.</hi> 9. Chriſt ſpeakes to <hi>Paul</hi> perſecuting the Church, as perſecuting himſelfe, <hi>Saul, Saul, why perſecuteſt thou mee?</hi> Now is not this a happy turne to haue ſuch a companion in our ſufferings, to haue Chriſt, as it were, bearing our croſſe, as <hi>Simon</hi> of Cyrene bare his?</p>
                  <p n="3">3. The powerfull preſence of Gods Spirit, chee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring and comforting vs in our affliction. Bleſſednes is nothing elſe but enioying ſweet co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>munion with God. Now ſith this communion is moſt of all en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ioyed in affliction, worthily are the afflicted coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted bleſſed, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 112. <hi>Vnto the righteous ariſeth light in darknes.</hi> That is, the lightning, and quickning preſence of God in affliction. And this was the Churches comfort, <hi>Mic.</hi> 7. 8. <hi>When I ſit in darknes, the Lord ſhall bee a light vnto mee.</hi> 2. <hi>Cor.</hi> 12. <hi>My power is made perfect in weaknes.</hi> When we are wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keſt, in regard of our affliction, and temptations,
<pb n="371" facs="tcp:257:192"/> then doth the power of Gods preſence moſt ſhew it ſelfe. And hence it is, that <hi>Rom.</hi> 5. 3. <hi>Afflictions bring forth patience,</hi> becauſe the loue of GOD is then moſt abundantly ſhed abroad in our hearts by the Spirit, as the words following ſhew. This is that which makes vs to reioyce in affliction, the ſweetnes of Gods loue, allaying the ſowrenes of af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fliction, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 91. 15. <hi>I will be with him in trouble.</hi> Oh then how happy things are afflictions, which bring with them ſo precious a pearle, as the ſweet com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany of God himſelfe, and the comforts of his Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit reioycing our ſoules in the multitude of the thoughts of our hearts, as <hi>Dauid</hi> ſhewes in the 17, 18, 19. verſes of this <hi>Pſalme,</hi> in his own experience! Therfore, as the <hi>Pſalmiſt</hi> ſpeaketh, <hi>Pſa.</hi> 107. of them that goe downe into the naturall Sea, that they ſee the wonderful works of the Lord, that much more may be ſaid of thoſe that goe into this Sea of af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fliction: oh they ſee &amp; feele many wonderful, and glorious works of the Lord, many heauenly and vnſpeakeable comforts, &amp; ioyes in the holy Ghoſt, that they neuer knew before in the day of their pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſperity. For God by his promiſe hath tyed his pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence to vs at that time, <hi>Eſay</hi> 43. 2. <hi>When thou paſſeſt thorow the vvaters, I will be with thee, &amp;c.</hi> But eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially this priuiledge belongeth to ſuch afflictions which we ſuffer for righteouſnes ſake; as the exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of the Apoſtles, ſinging in priſon, and the Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyrs, skipping for ioy in the midſt of the fiery flames doe manifeſtly declare.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. Good, in reſpect whereof afflictions make vs
<pb n="372" facs="tcp:257:193"/> happy, is the good confirmed vnto vs by them. This good is either <hi>preſent</hi> or <hi>future.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="1">1. The preſent good is our <hi>Adoption,</hi> whereof they are aſſured pledges, and badges vnto vs. <hi>Heb.</hi> 12. <hi>If you ſuffer affliction, God offers himſelfe vnto you as vnto ſonnes.</hi> When two children fight together in the ſtreet, and one comes and takes the one and whips him, and leaues the other; who will not ſay that the child taken and corrected, is that mans ſonne or pupill, and the other left, is none of his, but a ſtrangers? Againe, afflictions are the high beaten way to heauen, <hi>Acts</hi> 14. 22. in which onely the ſonnes of God walke. Neither doe afflictions onely aſſure vs, that we are the ſonnes of God, but ſonnes growne to ſome ſtrength and ripeneſſe; for young babes and infants are not able to beare af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fliction. This priuiledge alſo more ſpecially be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longs to ſuch affliction as wee ſuffer for the truths ſake, and is a ſpeciall point of their bleſſedneſſe. 1. <hi>Pet.</hi> 4. 11. <hi>If yee bee railed on for the Name of Chriſt, bleſsed are ye, for the Spirit of glory, and of God resteth on you, which on their part is euill ſpoken of, but on your part is glorified. Phil.</hi> 1. 28. <hi>And in nothing feare your aduerſaries, which to them is a token of perdition, but vnto you of ſaluation, and that of God: for vnto you it is giuen not onely to beleeue in him, but alſo to ſuffer.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Marke how ſufferings are made ſpeciall gifts of God, and aboue the gifts of beleeuing. He that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeueth, ſetteth to his hand and ſeale that God is true, <hi>Ioh.</hi> 3. 33. but when we ſuffer, wee come with a ſecond, and that a farre ſtronger ſeale. Therefore
<pb n="373" facs="tcp:257:193"/> ſuch are called Martyrs, that is, witneſſes, by way of excellency.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Good which afflictions confirme vnto vs, is <hi>future.</hi> And that two-fold.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. In this life, an enlargement of comforts both inward and outward, euen anſwerable to the mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure of afflictions. And in this regard are the afflic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted pronounced bleſſed, <hi>Mat.</hi> 5. <hi>Bleſsed are they that mourne, for they ſhall be comforted.</hi> They that ſowe in teares, ſhall reape in ioy. Affliction is the very ſeed of comfort. And therefore as ſeed caſt into the ground, promiſeth an harueſt; ſo do our afflictions promiſe comfort, both bodily and ſpirituall. Yea, the longer and ſtronger our afflictions be, the lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger and ſtronger comforts are thereby promiſed. For herein alſo is the Prouerbe true, He that ſowes liberally, ſhall reape liberally. Hence <hi>Moſes</hi> prayes, <hi>Pſalm.</hi> 90. 15. <hi>Comfort vs, O Lord, according to the dayes wherein thou haſt afflicted vs, and according to the yeeres wherein we haue ſeene euill.</hi> But afflictions doe not onely promiſe comforts, euen, and anſwe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable to themſelues, but farre exceeding, as the en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſe of good ſeede is oftentimes an hundred-fold. Thus was it with <hi>Iob, Iob</hi> 42. He had twice ſo much giuen him, as he loſt; and his laſt daies were better then his firſt. And the aduantage of an hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred-fold, is promiſed by our Sauiour euen in this life, <hi>Math.</hi> 19. 29. <hi>For as the ſufferings of Christ a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bound in vs, ſo our conſolation alſo abounds by Chriſt,</hi> 2. <hi>Cor.</hi> 1. 5.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. In the life to come. The afflictions of this
<pb n="374" facs="tcp:257:194"/> life, confirme vnto vs the hope of eternall life; <hi>For if we ſuffer with him, we ſhall alſo raigne with him,</hi> 2. <hi>Tim.</hi> 2. 12. The afflictions and troubles of this life, are happy aſſurances of the reſt of a better: See 2. <hi>Theſſal.</hi> 1. 4. 5. 6. 7. And not onely ſo, but the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle goes yet further, 2. <hi>Cor.</hi> 4. 17. <hi>For our light afflic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, which is but for a moment, worketh for vs a far more exceeding, and eternall weight of glory.</hi> What makes a man more bleſſed, then to haue that maſſy, and weighty crowne of glory vpon his head? Bleſſed is the man that is afflicted; for bleſſed is the man that ſhall be crowned. This is alſo more ſpecially the priuiledge of ſuch afflictions which we ſuffer for the truths ſake: <hi>Math.</hi> 5. 11. <hi>Bleſſed are yee when men ſhall perſecute you for my ſake, Reioyce and bee exceeding glad, for great is your reward in heauen.</hi> Thus were the Martyrs bleſſed in their af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flictions, bleſſed in their Martyrdome, God honou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring them like <hi>Elias,</hi> ſending for them, as M. <hi>Brad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ford</hi> ſpeakes, to heauen in a fiery chariot. Thus we ſee how in euery reſpect the afflicted are to bee ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counted bleſſed.</p>
                  <p>Why then ſhould wee feare afflictions be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they come, or faint vnder them after they <label type="milestone">
                        <seg type="milestoneunit">Vſe. </seg>
                     </label> become, or be impatient till they be gone? If they were curſes to vs, or wee curſed in them, then no wonder at our feare and fainting. But ſith wee may be bleſſed in them, why ſhould we ſo ſtart at them? Who would not willingly goe where a bleſſing goes? And goe to that Schoole, where hee ſhall learne that which will make him bleſſed? Goe wee
<pb n="375" facs="tcp:257:194"/> then cheerefully to the Schoole of afflictions, and not like loytring trewants, &amp; when in that Schoole, ply wee our buſines with that diligence, that when we are come thence, we may be able in our owne experience, and out of our owne learning, to ſay with <hi>Dauid</hi> here, <hi>Bleſsed is the man whom thou afflictest, O Lord, and teachest in thy Law.</hi>
